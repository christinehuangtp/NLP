ladyedan,"Reviewed in the United States on October 4, 2018",5 people found this helpful,4.0 out of 5 stars,This is a trilogy and if you start hold on to your seat fast paced and thrilling!,This was a good read it's a trilogy  the first and third books are a lot more fast paced and thrilling the second book dragged a  little in the middle for me. The main ie girl (Salander) is by far the best character you will definitely develop feeling for her in this trilogy. If you read book one then it's worth reading all 3 and it's very sad the author is no longer with us he would be happy to know there are so many people wishing for a 4th book ( I hear there might be a 4th script ready) . They are very enjoyable and full of edge of your seat fear very fast paced and nail biting the will make up want to jump in the book and save her to me that's a great read it I want to be part of it . I did not see the movie or read the Swedish books which I hear are absolutely brilliant. Sex trafficking is a very real problem all across the üåé globe .,,
NSM2016,"Reviewed in the United States on September 23, 2017",5 people found this helpful,5.0 out of 5 stars,An excellent trilogy comes to a satisfying end,"I was disappointed when this book came to an end, since I know it was the last book in the series authored by Stieg Larsson. I enjoyed book one, liked book two more than one and loved book three. As in his previous books, Larsson interweaves various storylines to create an intricate plot and he provides closure at the end of the book. One of the aspects I liked most about the book was the character development--specifically of Blomkvist and Salander. I recommend the series to anyone interested in an engaging story with engaging storylines and excellent character development.",,
Teddie S,"Reviewed in the United States on December 6, 2015",2 people found this helpful,4.0 out of 5 stars,Great character development AND plot development,"This is book #2 in the series by Stieg Larsson. In this book we learn more about the history of Lizbeth Salander, the female protagonist in The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo.  We get a much better understanding of Lizbeth's psyche, and how and why her violent childhood affected her in adulthood.  It would be an understatement to say she was not dealt a good hand, nor given a fair shake in life.  However, she is nothing if not a survivor.The main plot in book #2 revolves around human sex trafficking.  Three people are murdered and Lizbeth is the prime suspect.  Two of the murder victims were ""good guys"", and one was most certainly not. If the reader can stomach the graphic violence in parts of the book, it is an interesting and enjoyable read.  I guess what makes these books so satisfying is that the bad guys eventually get what's coming to them.I would venture  a guess that anyone who gets through books #1 & 2 will want to move on to #3.  At least I do.  I give this book 4 stars.",,
Beatlenik,"Reviewed in the United States on September 18, 2014",2 people found this helpful,5.0 out of 5 stars,Random House Large Print; Large Edition Soft Cover Product Review,"Steig Larsson‚Äôs Millenium Trilogy is one of the most documented, most reviewed, and most successful sellers on Amazon.  This review is not of the books per se, that would be about as redundant as possible.  This short review (if found like a needle in a haystack by someone looking for this specific topic) is a product review of the Random House Large Print editions in soft cover, which I purchased from Amazon as they came out in 2009-10.Volumes as large as this, purchased as mass-market paperbacks can be as cumbersome to read as eye strain can get.  If you are not a Kindle reader, take great comfort in physically holding a nice big book, and love that new book smell, this is the way to go.  The soft cover binding is both strong and pliable, easy to hold on your lap, in both your hands, or set up on your chest in bed.  The large print is a very comfortable contrast typeface that is perfect whether or not you wear glasses.  The paper quality is superb, and all in all, Random House has spared no expense at producing a high-quality product for boomers who like to read ‚Äúreal books‚Äù and want to rest the eyes when devouring a massive epic like this one.  At $20-25 per book, you might be thinking why not just buy the hard-back edition.  Good question!  At the time it was even higher priced than this one and I was under wallet restrictions.  I do have to say, however, these large editions are handsome on the shelf, feel nice and comfortable in handling, and offer the perfect mixture of easy on the eyes and perfect manual dexterity friendliness.  You can‚Äôt go wrong with a publisher like Random House, their bindings are solid, paper quality the highest, and their print is superior to many others.",,
Marcus Regulus,"Reviewed in the United States on April 30, 2014",4 people found this helpful,4.0 out of 5 stars,A riveting Noir tale,"I only gave this four stars as I think that  the first 20% of the book can be skipped.SPOILER ALERT.  Basically she travels around the world and has some adventures that have nothing whatsoever  to do with the rest of the story. If he had dropped this part and started when she arrives back in Sweden I would have given this a higher rating. Once back in Sweden the story takes off and has many twists  to keep you turning the pages. The book has very good pacing once back and kept me guessing as to what actually had occured and who had done what to whom. Although this is a still a dark tale of the soul, unlike the first book there is not as much explicit description of sexual deviation as in the first book. The author creates characters that seem real. They may not like each other for some vague reasons or even no reason at all, just like life.  On a lighter note , at least in the early oughts in Sweden, it seemed to me as though they must have consumed huge amounts of coffee. It was as though throughout the book everyone is either drinking coffee or making coffee or offering to make coffee .",,
Patricia N. Fisher,"Reviewed in the United States on January 25, 2020",,5.0 out of 5 stars,Outstanding,"I confess I am late to the dance--Lisbeth Salander's dance.  She has become my favorite female character and the books about her are fabulous.  After some slow going at first, the names confused me, I was hooked.  The plot is intricate but captivating.  Although a stand alone book, it helps to read the Millennium series in order.  If you like great characters, twisting plots, and a fascinating heroine, the Millennium series is as must.",,
Vikram Ramanathan,"Reviewed in the United States on April 26, 2012",3 people found this helpful,5.0 out of 5 stars,High octane ride,"I came to know about this series due to the Hollywood movie version of the first book - Girl with the dragon tattoo. I then stepped into the books. I have not yet seen the Swedish version of the 3 films from the books. Would like to see how that compares to the book. In any case, this book is a page turner. Steig Larson keeps the pressure by running parallel story lines. There are several characters in the book but it does not at any point feel like overkill. There are several stories taking place - there is the Salander thread, Bloomkvist + Millenium thread, a thread on investigative journalism on prostitution, the bad guys thread, Police investigation thread - officer Bublanski & friends plus Salander's Guardian thread and much more. There is some side commentary on mathematics - salander's subject of interest and an initially holiday getaway trip in an island. If SL had been alive he could have created separate franchises on several of these strong characters. I can imagine a Bloomkvist - Millenium only series, a series with Bublanski and friends etc. The book is fast paced. There is no verbose usage of English; it is all plain reading and fast. The book took me a bit of time to get adjusted to all the Swedish names for streets and addresses. A cool ride. I am now reading the third book - girl who kicked the hornet's nest which is an episodic continuation of the story in the 2nd book. I feel bad that this wild story arc is going to end soon and there are going to be no more Salander-Bloomkvist books after this one since the author is no more. Amazing how such a topnotch thrilling story was written as a personal hobby project (probably with the intention of publishing at some point) and then posthumously published. I noticed on the book jacket that Steig Larson did provide all three manuscripts for publishing just before his tragic death.",VINE VOICE,
Susan L. Jones,"Reviewed in the United States on June 29, 2017",2 people found this helpful,5.0 out of 5 stars,Captivating,"This is my second go-around of the whole series and I am as captivated by Salanger today as I was the first time I was introduced to her character. The Swedish series on Netflix is as intense as the books are. Looking forward to re-enter cc'ing myself to the third book in the series and then watching all the movies, again. As I stated, I prefer the Swedish versions, but still enjoy the American version, also.",,
doc peterson,"Reviewed in the United States on August 2, 2010",5 people found this helpful,5.0 out of 5 stars,I liked this much better than his debut,"In lieu of so many reviews, I'll keep the synopsis of _The Girl Who Played With Fire_ short.  Picking up a year (or so) after _The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo_, Blomkvist is dealing with the celebrity from his work with the Wenenrstrom affair, and Millenium financially is doing well, planning an issue (concurrent with the publication of a book) about the seedy world of prostitution, sex trafficing and what amounts to ""white slavery"" - young girls (early teens) brought to Sweden to serve as prostitues.  The writers of the story are murdered, dragging Blomkvist and Salander into the mystery of who did the crime and why._The Girl Who Played With Fire_ moves at a much faster pace than _Dragon Tattoo_, which was a relief.  That readers are given additional background into Salander's past - specifically why she was institutionalized and what ""All the Evil"" was that contributed to Salander being the intorvert she is, especially held my interest.  Apparently some did not care for the way in which Larsson showed events from the perspective of various characters - essentially ""rewinding"" the scene to provide another angle of the story.  I didn't mind the literary device, and in fact thought it provided addtional insight into the characters.I was bothered, however, by the intentional witholding of information regarding signficant plot points.  For example, Salander meets with the murder victims before they are found, leaving readers to suspect (perhaps) Salander is guilty of the crime, as the story does not provide any details of what she was doing there.  I understand that this was done to ""build suspense"" (and perhaps to put readers in the shoes of Blomkvist and others investigating the crime), but I found it trite.  This reservation aside, I really enjoyed the story and ""getting to know"" Salander better.As with so many book in a series, if you enjoyed _Dragon Tattoo_, you will absolutely love _Played With Fire_.  If you struggled with the pacing of the first, I would recommend this installment of the trilogy, as the ""first act"" (so to speak) is much more brief (the assumption being, I suppose, that we already are familiar with the protagonists).  If, on the other hand, you were among those who were bewildered at the buzz around Larsson's books, don't bother - there is nothing new here that would dissuade you otherwise.",,
K. Aszman,"Reviewed in the United States on July 19, 2012",,5.0 out of 5 stars,The story is outstanding but pages were missing!,"I purchased this book and was thrilled with it. I believe it is actually better than the first book in the trilogy, The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo. I literally devoured the book and was about 90%  through it when, as I moved on to another page the next page didn't make sense. I stopped short. Checked the page numbers and was shocked to find that 49 pages were missing. The last page I read was page 596. It then jumped to page 645. Talk about freaked out! This book really is a page turner and I was so into it that I immediately ran out of the house and down to my neighborhood bookstore. Thankfully, they had the book in stock. I think I would have driven an hour to find another copy. When I told the clerk my story she said that this sort of thing had happened to them too. It's a simple printing error. I never bothered trying to return the book. I'm sure I could get my money back but I'm not going to bother. However, if you purchase this book from this particular seller you might want to check to make sure those pages are there. The clerk said they sometime come in batches. Now as far as the actual story...if you liked The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo you are really going to love The Girl Who Played with Fire. I couldn't put it down. Oh, and make sure you have the third book at your side because I can promise you, you are going to want to just pick that one up and keep reading. It picks up immediately where this book ends. It is such a shame that Stieg Larsson is no longer with us. He has created one of the most unusual heroines I have ever met. The writing itself is exceptional. The plot line is complex enough to keep you intrigued. But the best part is his character development. I love the characters. Blomkvist, Berger, and all the others are very real; very believable. The bad guys are really nasty; you will love to hate them. But the shining star of the story is Lisbeth. There will never be another heroine like Lisbeth Salander. He broke the mold with this one. Grab this book and you won't put it down. It will keep you on the edge of your seat. And remember to have The Girl Who Kicked the Hornet's Nest ready and waiting!",,
Dandelion,"Reviewed in the United States on July 7, 2012",,5.0 out of 5 stars,Riveting,"I normally do not expect a sequel to be better than the 1st book, but this one is an exception. I very much liked the first, ""The Girl With the Dragon Tatoo"", but this goes way beyond that book.The book is not for a sensitive soul or an idealistic one. It is raw and brutal and touches on aspects of life that perhaps we would rather not know about. Somehow the author puts humanistic and idealism and heroism in that pool of muck and creates an ever twisting, riveting conflict.The heroine is not saint. I loved her because she isn't a saint. She is not the sterotype smart blond with an improbable body (that we see so often on TV); she is a a waif. A waif with a piercing intelligence that will get her mission does. She is violent and extremely anti-social and a true misfit for good reason too. In this sequel the reason that the heroine, Salander, acts like that is exposed. We finally understand the roots of her behavior.The actions and reactions of the people around her are written masterfully and convincingly. The threads of substories are interesting in themselves and you quickly realize that those stories are there for a reason and sooner or later all those threads will be woven together with surprises.The sections on the outlandish connections the press made without proper documentation made me want to scream. However, I realize that this sort of exaggeration goes on everyday. Thus we are forced to look at the creation of sensationalism in the press and see what it is - it sells newpapers and ruins people's lifes. It judges without a jury. It labels and implies and misstates almost without restrain. It is out price for a free press but also the curse of it. If you read this book just to focus on this material you will have an eye opener.I found myself reading this book much faster than the first. When I finished I just had to go out and buy the third and last book. I did not wait to order it from Amazon, but found it at a bookstore. This is something I rarely do, but the series is that good.If you liked ""The Girl With the Dragon Tatoo"" you must read this and then buy the third one too.",,
Davewise,"Reviewed in the United States on June 12, 2012",,5.0 out of 5 stars,Amazing... but incomplete,"After having enjoyed the first book in the series so much, I looked forward to reading this second one and I wasn't disappointed. The story was gripping, fast-paced, and even more engaging than the first. While the style and many of the characters are the same as ""The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo"", this is by no means a repeat. Blomkvist felt more like the lead in ""...Tattoo"", but here the focus is clearly on Salander. Much of the book is from her point of view and a lot of the story revolves around her past. Those who have read the first book will know what an interesting character she is and it was even better to find out more of her past - her family, the incidents that led officials to label her crazy, and more.Like the first book, this one is part mystery, part thriller. Here there are 3 murders committed and the police quickly identify Salander as the prime suspect. After the fallout from their parting, Blomkvist and Salander aren't exactly on speaking terms, but he still does his best to prove her innocence. Three very different investigations are under way, with the police, Milton Security, and the team at ""Millennium"" each trying to determine what happened but each with their own take on it. Salander meanwhile has her own questions and does everything as much on her own as possible. The case involves an expose on the sex trafficking business as well as government secrets.The story quickly roped me in and I wanted to read more and more as I went on. My one complaint is with the ending. While the first book had a satisfying ending where a sequel could be done but the book still felt like a whole, this one finishes with too many loose ends. It's clear that the next book needs to more or less pick up where this one left off, whereas there was some elapsed time between the first and second. There aren't too many unanswered questions, but there are things left unresolved.",,
M. Skwiat,"Reviewed in the United States on June 19, 2010",5 people found this helpful,5.0 out of 5 stars,Better than the First,"All this buzz is swirling around about Stieg Larsson and his Millenium series.  Not going into the details of how or why it's so popular, I can comment and review the books themselves.  Having read the first one, and believing it to be a pretty good thriller, I found the second one on Amazon and decided to give it a go.  Whereas in the first one I found the plot to be interesting and rather titillating I felt that it was missing something.  Sure Blomkvist was a likable hero and his journey to uncover a family mystery was interesting to read.  It was perhaps Larson's creation of Lisbeth Salander that really got me interested in the book.  She is one of the most exciting characters to come along in a while possessing similarities of Lara Croft, 007, Jason Bourne and a whole slew of other action heroes.  She made the first book exciting, but I still felt the first one lacked something, or maybe I was just let down that it wasn't as good as I wanted it to be.  The second one, however, packed a punch that left me craving to read it at work, at school, and deep in the night.  What makes the second one so good is the slow unraveling of Lisbeth Salander.  In the second one we find her a changed person from the first novel.  In The Girl Who Played with Fire she is a lot more grown up and the mysteries that surrounded her in the first novel begin to reveal themselves.  My pulse was pounding to find out what was going to happen next.  I also felt the character development was solid.  All our old friends from the first one our back and each is given their own time to reveal themselves.  The plot I also felt was stronger in The Girl Who Played with Fire.  Trying to sum up this story to a friend is difficult because the plot is so tightly bound with mysteries being uncovered left and right.  It's a thrilling murder mystery, family drama, government cover up, and feminist fable of power.  I highly recommend this novel and look forward to the third one.",,
callibug9,"Reviewed in the United States on February 19, 2014",,5.0 out of 5 stars,Made me want to read the next one ASAP!,"This book is written in the same style as The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, which I really like, but if you take issue with it, just know this one is the same as far as that goes. This book, however, is much more fast-paced and suspenseful than the first one. The first one has some action and suspense, but is mostly research and discovery into the mystery.Although the story is told in third-person, Stieg Larsson just has this way of revealing only what he wants you to know sometimes painfully! It's very cool how he dives in and follows certain characters in a manner that makes you keep turning pages.You do not need to have read the first book in order to understand this story--the story is separate with many of the same characters, the important points of the first one are well-explained throughout. It helps so you can understand the main character a little bit, but this story goes much more into her background and history.I found the first book great reading but sometimes painfully slow. This book deviates from the slow pace of the first one. I bought the 3rd book as soon as I finished this one and will review when finished!",,
John F. Rooney,"Reviewed in the United States on August 5, 2010",One person found this helpful,4.0 out of 5 stars,The Film Version Is Better,"""The Girl Who Played with Fire"" - luckily I saw the excellent movie version before I ventured into the 630 page novel. The film is focused, tighter, on target, concise, and gives you all of the essentials of the book. The novel is all over the place, diffuse, too gangling, unfocused, has long sections of unnecessary detail and other plot strands that have nothing to do with the central plot arc. I found the book to be a heavy slog, and had a hard time getting through it. At its heart, though, it has the fascinating and deeply involving story of one of modern literature's most vibrant characters, Lisbeth Salander.Lisbeth has been away from Sweden for a year since we last saw her in ""Tattoo"" living a life of luxury abroad. She purchases an apartment in Stockholm, but no one knows about it. Unfortunately she talks her former girlfriend into taking over her old apartment, and the girl becomes a target for Lisbeth's enemies. Lisbeth wants to get her records from her sadistic guardian, Bjurman, but he is cooperating with her arch enemy ZalaLisbeth's boyfriend from the first novel in the series, Mikael Blomkvist, spends most of his time trying to track her down. He's publisher of the counter-culture magazine Millennium. He has hired a free lancer to write an article about sex traffickers and the johns that are involved in the trade. The writer intends to out some of the prominent johns, and one of the johns is from the Swedish secret service. The writer's girlfriend is also working on revealing the sex ring.The two narratives converge at a crucial stage when Lisbeth is accused of three murders, and the police start a massive hunt for her, although they aren't very effective, and she is able to move around with relative ease. Get ready for violence, sex, gore, torture scenes, and suspense as we follow the protagonists. Lisbeth always seems to be immersed in trouble and with men who hate women. There's some computer hacking in this one that keeps her ahead of everyone else. Lisbeth's barbarous father whom she had torched as a child comes back with a vengeance in this sequel.The novel ends in a cliffhanger that will entice readers into seeking out the third book in the series.I liked the first novel more than this one because it was more focused and involved more interaction between the two principals, Lisbeth and Mikael; it was more human and more affecting than this one.Lisbeth is as tough and wily as ever. It's an intricately plotted, labyrinthine, tantalizing mystery.",,
clifford,"Reviewed in the United States on August 10, 2009",2 people found this helpful,4.0 out of 5 stars,I am an enormous fan of Larsson. This book just doesn't quite make the grade.,"As an author, Stieg Larsson is someone of whom you just cannot say enough good things about. Not only was his story telling unique in style, but in substance as well. His characters are fleshed out above and beyond a mere mystery. The plots of his stories are so complex and deep, that you get lost in them and once you are finished you look back in awe over the creation.I don't know enough about the life and early death of Stieg Larsson. All I know is that the first two of the three books he left to be published comprise what can only be considered to be one of the all time classic mystery/thriller genre book series.Once again we are given the admirable character of Mikael Blomkvist as a protagonist. The story starts off with him and his familiar cast of Milennium Magazine getting ready to publish an expose on the sex trade of Sweden. We are also re-acquainted with Salander, a quite introvert genius (negative note #1, Larsson is falling into an old trap where the author falls in love with his characters. Salander is morphed here in this second installment from a simpler character into one with almost super-hero qualities which instead of setting her apart, instead makes her feel almost like a character based on a Marvel comic book.)Ok, so you know that I love Larsson, love the characters, and I even really enjoyed the story. Why would I give this book only 4 stars then??? Well, this is based on purely personal reasons for the most part. I am a reader who hates jumping from character to character, and the more characters who find themselves in the roll of first person, the more I hate the story. However, ""The Girl Who Played With Fire"" relies upon this trick more heavily than just about any other novel I have ever read. Larrson writes in nice short chapters, and they are always seen through someone different eyes. I bet I could go back and dig up 30 different first person studies. Larsson, great writer that he is, still manages to avoid the most common flaws here and pulls it off better than most. It was just a lot more bumpier of a read than it needed to be.Perhaps most egregious, Larsson plays with the plot, suspense and arc of the story by mashing all of the story lines into one convergence. I am not giving anything away here because this information can be found on the books dust jacket. We are following Salander along quite nicely. Once she is accused of the triple murders, she flees and the story forgets her. Alot of what thus ensues could have been answered quickly if we had only stayed in her head and not started to jump all around from character to character.Or perhaps I could put it this way... Larsson falls back on a lazy mans writing trick by jumping from one persons mind to the next. He fills in gaps and keeps the story moving along this way. However, the most important bits surrounding Salander, Larsson goes the opposite route and keeps these moments hidden from the reader. Thus giving a very false sense of urgency and suspense. I can't forgive him for trashing the novel so heavily with this ploy. The rest of the writing structure and style would definitly merrit 5 stars, but...",,
My 2 Cents,"Reviewed in the United States on January 10, 2012",,4.0 out of 5 stars,Great Follow up ~ but too much minutiae,"In this follow up to The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo, the second book of the Millennium series, The Girl Who Played With Fire, was probably even more fast paced than book one. In my opinion, you should read these books in order, as you'll really get a better feel for Lisbeth Salander, and what has been going on with her.As this story begins, Lisbeth Salander enjoying her new wealth, altering or should I say enhancing her appearance through plastic surgery, and relaxing at a hotel in Grenada as a terrible storm looms. Back in Sweden no one knows where she is, but Mikel Blomkvist, publisher of Millennium magazine, is preparing to run an explosive feature exposing of the underage sex slave business in Sweden, which involves some top-ranked officials and crooked cops. The day before the feature is to run the journalist responsible, Dag Svensson and his partner Mia, are murdered. The following day there is another murder, that of Nils Bjurman.  Although he seems unconnected to the other two,  he happened to be Lisbeth Salander's legal guardian.When the same fingerprints show up in both of these cases, the hunt is on for the elusive Lisbeth Salander.  Even her old pal Blomkvist has no idea where she is, but he believes she is innocent and wants to help prove it.  Having tapped into his computer, Lisbeth communicates in cryptic ways sending clues about who might be responsible.The book started out full steam, but then had several lulls throughout the 600+ page storyline (much could have been eliminated, in my opinion). There were too many unnecessary details, throughout the book.  Don't get me wrong, this was still a fantastic story.  I liked the direction the continuation of this series took, and while some interesting things were revealed about Lisbeth's family history, I felt the that the introduction lead the reader to believe that we would learn a lot more about why she is the way she is.  That just didn't happen.  The story did pick up again in the last third of the book, with lots more action and revelations, which made me as the reader anxious to read the final book of the series.",VINE VOICE,
Solipso,"Reviewed in the United States on January 11, 2012",,5.0 out of 5 stars,A good sequel to the first volume of Larsson's The Girl Who... trilogy.,"Warning! Do not read the blurb on this book's dust jacket. It spoils what would otherwise be an eye-opening surprise. As with its predecessor, THE GIRL WHO PLAYED WITH FIRE's best quality is its heroine. Though she is not as fresh and original as when I met her in the first volume, her history is amplified in the second volume. She is interesting enough that material I would ordinarily judge inappropriate and boring was acceptable and interesting. For example, Stieg Larsson describes at length the heroine's mundane tasks of buying clothes, buying an apartment, and furnishing the apartment. Also, Larsson describes the heroine's vacation activities in the Caribbean and her meeting of a boyfriend there, neither of which has anything to do with the plot. Indeed much of the first hundred or so pages of the book have nothing to do with the plot. Still it is interesting.I advise that you have recently read the first volume before reading this one. You do not absolutely need to, but information from the first volume supplements the second and provides you with a richer overall picture. Also, the staffs of Milton Security and of Millennium magazine return in the second volume, and it is pleasant to be familiar with them.Regarding the plot, it had an unexpected flavor. The plot revolves around illegal trafficking and enslavement of young prostitutes. So I expected it to proceed like Liam Neeson's movie TAKEN. He played a father whose daughter was kidnapped and turned into a sex slave. The Neeson hero locates the traffickers' nest, barges in, shoots the place up, and rescues his daughter. But despite the theme of sex trafficking, Stieg Larsson's plot is quite different from the movie's. None of the scenes occur in a trafficking nest, or any kind of whorehouse, and there is no rescue like the Neeson character's. Though Larsson's novel has sex and action, the story is not one of heroic rescue. It is investigative journalism. More scholarly, if you will.",,
Larry Hoffer,"Reviewed in the United States on August 10, 2012",,5.0 out of 5 stars,Stieg Larsson hit his stride with the second book in his trilogy...,"You've got to love books that make you stay up as late as necessary to finish them. Stieg Larsson's The Girl Who Played with Fire, second in the ""Millennium Trilogy,"" was one of those books for me. And much like many other series of novels I've read, Larsson definitely hit his stride with this book. While the first book in the series, The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, was tremendously gripping and well-written, it definitely suffered a bit from an overload of details that didn't necessarily move the plot forward. But this book, while starting a bit slow, was definitely stronger than its predecessor.Reporter Mikael Blomkvist is working with a freelance journalist on an article and book exposing sex trafficking in Sweden, a problem that has reached epidemic proportions and involved politicians, judges and policemen. Just before the article and book are to be published, the journalist and his girlfriend (on whose doctoral dissertation the expos√© is based) are murdered. The suspect in these brutal murders, as well as one additional murder, is Lisbeth Salander, Blomkvist's socially awkward yet brilliant sometime-friend and researcher. Blomkvist is convinced of Salander's innocence even while the facts against her are mounting, and he defies the police and other enemies to try and figure out who really murdered his friends, while at the same time, forces from Salander's past are trying to remove her from the picture for good.This book read like a movie. The action is great, some of the twists actually made me gasp, and Larsson never lets his main characters be one-dimensional. If you're like me and usually shy away from the books everyone else on Earth is reading, take my advice: read this one.",,
Born2Late65,"Reviewed in the United States on October 26, 2010",One person found this helpful,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Some mistakes, but an entirely enjoyable read.","Hi,I usually try not to write spoilers. After reading the first book. I decided not to follow this one while noting every little inconsistency or problem. I enjoyed this second book even more than the first from Herr Larsson. I am sometimes too [...]for my own good. There was only one major plot oopie in the first book (Old man Vanger would have known to look for the archival pix from the newspaper. He was an old newspaperman himself. The detective certainly would have as well.). Plus the minor fact that Mr.Larsson wasn't very knowledgeable about Glocks (Salander flicked the safety on a Glock. There is no manual safety on a Glock. That's one of their strong points.).The biggest problem I found in the second book? Salander's prints on the gun. Neanderthal man (Niedermann, in German) had huge hands. His gloves would have smudged any prints on that gun (including the cylinder) so much as to make them useless. It is highly unlikely that a viable print would have survived all the handling required to do his travels & murders. As an aside. I looked it up out of curiosity. There is a genetic disorder like what he had. It's acronym is CIPA (Congenital Insensitivity to Pain disorder w/Anhidrosis). Happily, that disorder is incredibly rare in real life.Now to be a bit of a wanker... As it turns out w/the second installment. He wasn't very knowledgeable about firearms, period. There is no such thing as a 45 Colt Magnum. Carbon did offer some highly specialized ammo w/this designation printed on the box. It wasn't true magnum ammo, though. It was only +P, & only meant for guns like the 454 Cassull. His continual references to special ""Hunting ammo"" must be unique to restrictive Swedish gun laws. A hollow point is a hollow point. Carry ammo, or hard ball, it's as simple as that. He didn't cite which Browning pistol in 22 caliber. So, I'll leave probable wound realities out of it. Did I mention I'm sometimes too [...]? Sorry... His cardiac information is off, too (washed-out cop w/slight hole in pericardium).The part about Salander being willing to lie down & die. While Zalachenko was still breathing? It was certainly out of character for her. Personally, I'd find her collapsing, unable to make it back to the shed due to her wounds, much more believable. The thing is. In real life, people do do things like that. However paradoxical their actions may seem. So, I can't fault it for that. I enjoyed this book a lot, & am looking forward to starting the third :-). I deeply hope Herr Larsson lived long enough to realize how successful his work would be.",,
Justin Lee,"Reviewed in the United States on June 7, 2010",One person found this helpful,4.0 out of 5 stars,Review for THE MILLENNIUM TRILOGY (Part 2 of 3),"Note: I'm trying to write this as a review of the entire Millennium trilogy, broken into three parts. For those who are wondering how the trilogy should be read, my opinion is to read them in order and back-to-back. Although Larsson does a fine job of re-introducing recurring characters, it helps to know their back story; and back-to-back because Larsson's cast of character is HUGE. I've written up a list of characters for the trilogy, which you are free to use and distribute as you wish [...]. I also made a more condensed version [...] that removes all the minor or non-recurring characters. If you do read this trilogy and you're unfamiliar with Sweden (as I am), you might want a map of Sweden on hand or have Google Maps handy. It's not necessary, but it did help me picture things better in my head. This is especially true of the latter two books, which  explores Sweden a lot more. Google Maps is especially great for this because you can use Street View for many of the locations.THE MILLENNIUM TRILOGY (Part 2 of 3)The Girl Who Played With FirePLAYED WITH FIRE begins about two years after the events of DRAGON TATTOO. The first part of the book covers what Salander has been up to during this period, and focuses on the time she spends vacationing in Granada. At this point, she has become fairly well-off, and is able to buy, travel, and do everything she wants. She has very little attachment to the people in DRAGON TATTOO, including Blomkvist.Most of this book is about Salander. Blomkvist, who was the protagonist in the first book, takes a back seat role. However, Salander, being a curious person, inevitably gets caught up in the intrigues around her. This book goes deeper into her back story, including the ""All The Evil"" event that was hinted at in DRAGON TATTOO. Towards the middle of the book, Salander disappears from the narrative, and Blomkvist returns to the  focus of the story. A series of murders has occurred, and Blomkvist has to uncover the events that linked seemingly disparate people and events together.My thoughts on this book:1. Salander is an interesting character, no doubt. It was hard for me (and, I imagine, others) to compared her to a kind of female Hannibal Lecter. She is unimaginably smart, and incorruptible, to the point of being nearly superhuman. She has her own system of morals that makes sense to her, and she can be lethal if she wants to be.2. There were scenes in the book that reminded me of the ethics of torture, which seems to work in context. It's particularly interesting in light of the fact that Larsson is so vocal on social matters, especially those pertaining to violence. He speaks out against real-life crimes that has happened in Sweden, and yet he puts the reader in the position of wondering about his position about ""extreme interrogation tactics"" when it pertains to people who don't have our sympathies.3. PLAYED WITH FIRE (and HORNET'S NEST) feels distinctly different from DRAGON TATTOO. Those who were expecting a similar structure might be surprised. Although there is a murder to solve, the reader more or less finds out the answer well before the end of the novel. As such, it's not so much a murder mystery, as it is about how people from different parts of society piece together evidence.4. The Granada episode was out of place. I suppose Larsson included it to inform readers about what has been happening to Salander, and to give some insight into her character. Perhaps this episode would have had significance in the future novels that, unfortunately, won't be written. It wasn't that it was badly written--Larsson is an excellent writer--but that it was jarring to be taken from one context to another so abruptly. Maybe it was there for foreshadowing or symbolism or something to signal a coming storm.5. I'm unfamiliar with Swedish politics and history, and I wonder whether there are aspects of the book that someone who is familiar would see. For example, whether the characters are real-life people (good or bad) that Larsson is trying to portray.6. I do get lost with the number of characters in this series. Again, I suspect this is because Larsson, from what I understand, had been planning a longer series.Don't get me wrong. I'm enjoying this series, and I highly recommend it. It's exceedingly well-written. As I mentioned in the review of DRAGON TATTOO, book two and three of the Millennium series feels like a single volume separated into two books. At the very least, I would suggest reading those back-to-back.",,
Westley,"Reviewed in the United States on October 31, 2010",One person found this helpful,4.0 out of 5 stars,"""There are no innocents. There are, however, different degrees of responsibility.""","I enjoyed ""The Girl Who Played with Fire"" slightly more than the first novel in the series.  On the positive side, the action starts much more quickly than in the first book.  The pacing is also better overall, with less focus on political issues and behind-the-scenes issues regarding Millennium magazine.  The book also adds some interesting background to Salander's character (most of which cannot be revealed without massive spoilers).  I'll also give small kudos to the book for bringing attention to a worthy issue - the trafficking of sex slaves, although I've seen this topic handled on several police procedural television shows, like ""The Wire.""On the negative side, the book simply did not focus enough on the two main characters - Salander and Blomkvist.  Instead, much of the investigation is conducted by numerous interchangeable police detectives and even several researchers from Salander's old employer, Dragan Armansky at Milton Security.  These characters aren't memorable at all, although Larsson tries to inject them with a few broad characteristics.  So many pages are wasted with these minor characters debating Salander's guilt and murmuring that the case makes no sense.  These characters are constantly perplexed by Salander's seemingly disjointed nature...""How could a girl so small like Salander be so vicious?""  Yawn.  Likewise, the character of ""the giant"" (as he is known through most of the book) was rather ridiculous.As with the first entry in the series, this novel also could have been shortened and tightened up quite a bit.  Some of the secondary characters could have been combined, along with much of their meandering and repetitive musings about Salander and ""the giant.""  The biggest disappointment is that Salander often disappears for large chunks of the book.  Again, better editing would have solved this dilemma, as her absense really doesn't create much tension or mystery.My ultimate question for an entry in a mystery/crime series is whether I am tempted to purchase the next one.  As soon as I finished ""The Girl Who Played with Fire,"" I immediately downloaded the next book onto my kindle and watched the movie version on my roku.  Larsson clearly has done some things right with this series.  I just wish that it had all been edited better!",,
Mobius Strip,"Reviewed in the United States on September 1, 2010",2 people found this helpful,3.0 out of 5 stars,Would you like coffee with that?,"There's a difference between a good storyteller and good writer and Stieg Larsson is not a good writer.He's a master of the irrelevant detail with a weird fixation on coffee.His characters ""start coffee,"" ""pour coffee,"" are ""impressed"" with others' coffee-making skills. I swear F. Scott Fitzgerald did not mention booze as much in all his stories as Larsson mentions coffee in this one book. If Larsson had written ""Moby Dick,"" the opening line would be ""Call me Ishmael and join me for a coffee...""Larson seems to very often miss the point that good thriller writers know about what information to give and what to withhold, and what characters know and what the reader should know and when.Then there's the needless and draining repetition.In one tiresome chapter, he gives us a police press conference where all the information (and I mean ALL) is stuff we already know, but is presented again in detail.There's a 100 page section that's truly risible in its irrelevance. Characters investigate and hit dead ends and ""uncover"" information we already know. We, the reader, are ahead of the characters, and that's always tedious (unless the characters are being drawn suspenseful into a trap, which is not the case).As Eric Asimov wrote, you can't wait for Larsson's books to end (as opposed to not wanting them to end) but I have to admit, that despite all their many flaws, I sort of enjoy reading these books. I also spend a lot of time wondering why.I think it's because, Larsson is a good storyteller, and he creates compelling characters. His Lisbeth Salander is singular pleasure to follow, and whenever she's on the page, the story crackles. Just being inside her head is a perverse pleasure.I'll probably read the next installment (which is supposed to be much better than ""...Played with Fire"") and then be glad they're over (but not glad for the reason, of course).",,

Warfield,"Reviewed in the United States on May 20, 2011",One person found this helpful,5.0 out of 5 stars,Loving Stieg Larsson's Second,"After reading The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo twice, I turned to The Girl Who Played With Fire, Stieg Larsson's second in his trilogy of books that feature Lisbeth Salander and Mikael Blomkvist. I loved the almost leisurely beginning of this one where Lisbeth is found vacationing in the tropics, enjoying the sun and carrying around not the latest best seller, but a very large mathematics book which she is studying. She has given Mikael Blomkvist the cold shoulder now for a long time, but with no reason.  In the meantime, Blomkvist, along with his Millenium staff, are working on an account of exposing members of a sex trafficking ring, which they plan on publishing sometime in the near future.Mikael stops by the apartment of two friends who have information on some of the traffickers, and upon entering the apartment, finds the two shot dead.  A piece of evidence at the crime scene links it to Lisbeth Salander, and the hunt starts for her as the prime suspect in this crime.  During the second half of the book, there is a lot of action and suspense, and the ending is extremely surprising, leaving me with that ""I can't wait to find out"" feeling again.I love Lisbeth's character for her strength and self-sufficiency and also her brilliance.  I love Mikael Blomkvist for his dedication as a friend and his cool-headedness.  There are also characters who appear in the novel who deserve my loathing. While waiting for the third and final installment in the trilogy, I read this one a second time, too.If you haven't read these books, start with the first one or else you'll be lost.  They are well worth the time spent reading them.",TOP 1000 REVIEWER,
Viola Chen,"Reviewed in the United States on May 26, 2011",,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Fun and thrilling, but disappointing ending","With the Vanger family mystery solved and nicely wrapped up in the first book, the second book in the Millennium series, The Girl Who Played With Fire, takes on a mystery much closer to home. It more directly involves the two central characters that we grew to love in the first book -- Mikael Blomkvist and Lisbeth Salander. The author spends a lot of time in this novel developing these characters, particularly Lisbeth Salander. As the book progressed, I grew quite attached to this petite, tattooed, and pierced rebel outcast. Although I am nothing like her (as I have a distaste for violence, am better integrated into society, and don't care for piercings or tattoos), I related to her introversion and identified with her outsider status. I admired her fearlessness. When the author deliberately removed her point of view in the middle of the book, I discovered that I missed her. Her character development was the best thing about this book.Still, make no mistake; as much as I appreciated the character development of Lisbeth Salander, this book, like the first one, is primarily a plot-driven book. The first book has two speeds - very slow and very fast. This second book is much more evenly paced at about medium-fast. My interest in this book never waned from start to finish, but I never had the same intense page-flipping, holding your breath, gotta-know-what-happens-next experience that I had with the first book.It should be noted that even though the beginning of the book maintained my interest, the real mystery of the book doesn't present itself until about one-third of the way in. One-third is quite a lot to get through before you even understand the main premise of the book. Many of the introductory pages could have been edited out; they weren't bad just unnecessary.Any and all positive feelings that I had for this book were killed with an unbelievable plot twist at the end of the book. Without giving away any spoilers, let me just say that it is something that has been done before in other books, TV shows, and movies. Every time it is done, I am exasperated and I roll my eyes. I especially hated it in this book probably because of how much I was enjoying the book. I typically don't like elements that are not real and will only suspend my disbelief so far in novels. The plot twist probably would not bother most readers. But if you are like me and have issues with unrealistic elements in storytelling, then you might not care for the ending either.Because the ending was such a let down, I'm not sure about whether or not I will read the third book next. This indecision is surely unusual as the second book ends on a cliffhanger. I took a break in between the first and second book, so perhaps I will take a break between the second and third as well. I probably would not have been so affected if I hadn't enjoyed the rest of the book as much as I did.",,
SR,"Reviewed in the United States on June 19, 2011",,5.0 out of 5 stars,A Fitting Sequel,"There is always, at least for me, a feeling of uncertainty in the pit of my stomach when I pick up the sequel to a brilliantly crafted premiere novel. That being said, I fully appreciate this novel's value. It was a fitting sequel by all means, yet I do not compare it to ""Dragon Tattoo,"" as I view it in a completely different light.Blomkvist and Salander are again the main characters in this sequel, yet the entire book is shook from all expectations when Salander is haunted, once again, by events from her past and is accused of a brutal triple murder. When her fingerprints are found on the murder weapon, Blomkvist, whom Salander has been ignoring for over a year, is forced to come to her rescue, as her face is plastered all over Sweden and newspapers begin to portray her in hardly positive, hardly fair lights. As a former committed patient, Salander not only has to face down the evidence against her but also the discrimination against her because of her past.As the investigation unfolds however, Blomkvist finds out that the murders have a more sinister motive than the police believe, exposing a sex-trafficking business that ultimately implicates individuals from Salander's past who are only too willing to have her implicated. Failing this, they also seek to finish her off themselves. In the end, lives are on the line as Blomkvist races against time to clear Salander before it is too late.This book is just as good of a thriller as Larsson's first, yet the feeling is completely different. The past again plays a role, yet the danger feels more real, more current, than in ""Dragon Tattoo."" This is not to say that this novel is more engrossing, because, personally, I preferred the chilling feeling I experienced while reading ""Dragon Tattoo,"" which was of a slower pace, to this work. Yet this novel is excellent in its own right due to its fast-paced nature. What I will mention, however, is that it is a tad slow at the beginning as the groundwork is laid, but this does not largely detract from enjoyment.So, wrapping up, this is a fitting sequel. Personally, I preferred Larsson's opening to the trilogy better, yet I can see the verdict being passed either way as to preference between the two!",,
M. Silverstein,"Reviewed in the United States on March 21, 2010",One person found this helpful,5.0 out of 5 stars,I guess I'm hooked...,"So I read The Girl With The Dragoon Tattoo and loved it, so I picked up the sequel and couldn't put it down.  The Girl Who Played With Fire definitely picks up where the first left off although with a new ""case"" to solve.  And like the first, I'm always a bit confused with the first and last names of the characters - Larsson uses both - so sometimes I'm not sure who's being referred to.  This isn't a dig on the book or author, just my own issue that I noticed.Here in this latest action packed book, you'll find yourself getting caught up in a world of underground crime and violence that packs a punch.  One of the things that I use to evaluate a book is whether or not I have any of those ""whoa, I never saw that coming"" moments.  And in this book, I actually had a few - some more than others - but one was a whopper (don't worry no spoilers here).One of the reviews I read had said this book was full of cliches but I've been sitting here trying to think of what s/he was referring to.  Yes, you do have the good guys, the bad guys, the ones caught in middle but the twists and turns that Larsson throws at you are fun and exciting...at least for me they were.  Maybe these are the cliches but I guess if this is the case, I'd like a few more please!I do suppose in an instance or two, some things could be a little farfetched but the subsequent explanations seem plausible.  One thing I did enjoy was having some of my questions answered that remained from the first book.  I wanted to know a bit more about some of the characters in the first book and, unfortunately, Larsson never detailed them.  Anyway, a good portion of these nagging questions were answered and I was left fulfilled...only to open a few more though :)  Hopefully the third (already on order) will tie everything together in a nice little package for me!Overall, I gave this a 5-star review because I truly did enjoy everything about it.  I guess if I had to pick one thing that left me feeling empty was the ending, or maybe better stated: left me wanting more.  You'll just have to read the book to find out why.Enjoy!!",,
Sheila Deeth,"Reviewed in the United States on March 21, 2011",,4.0 out of 5 stars,Worthy Sequel. Lisbeth is a great character,"The Girl Who Played with Fire is the second of Stieg Larsson's Millennium Trilogy, and a worthy sequel to The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo. I'm still not sure these are the best books I've read, or even nearly the best, but they're certainly enjoyable. The characters become more real in this book, or at least more complex. I enjoyed seeing Lisbeth building her new life, and the old hurts breaking through to break it down were convincingly revealed with a nice sense of timing. The action, when it happened, was fast and furious. Dark scenery and busy streets were powerfully evocative. And the mystery unfolds with twists and turns but a convincing feeling of connection, and satisfying conclusion. There are questions still unanswered, and disaster still only partially averted, so I'll certainly have to read book three.The book is long, of course, at 630 pages. And long descriptions remind me of books I read as a child, making me think how movies, and books, today tend to move so much faster and leave so much more for the reader, or watcher, to work out. The author's commentary on events and politics is fascinating--refreshing since he's not American and America's preoccupations aren't the center of his universe--but they slow the story, making me skip bits and cut back, trying not to be such a lazy reader. The journalistic and investigative processes are described in detail, and really did draw me in at last. And the mix of characters, helpful, evil and in-between is very neatly drawn.Lisbeth is certainly a strong female lead and I'm really quite eager for more--looking forward to the next.Disclosure: I did it again. We watched the movie first. I like the book better.",VINE VOICE,

I read the first book on my Kindle and immediately downloaded this one and started reading as if it were just the next chapter.  I liked this book even better than the first because the Lisbeth Salander character was my favorite and this book gives us a closer look into her background although much is still in question by the end of the book.  Nonetheless, we begin to see some of the reasons that she is so introverted and such a free spirit.  We also see Blomkvist back in his office at Millennium after taking close to a year off to write a book and solve the mysteries in The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo.I don't want to give away any of the storyline, not that it would be easy to do so since this book, like the first is very involved with lots of twists and turns.  There is lots of mystery, suspense, and thrills throughout the book.  If you've read the first book you probably already like both of these characters as well as some of the supporting cast such as Erika, Blomkvist's boss and sometime lover and others in the Millennium office.  You'll like them even more after reading this book as you learn more secrets about them and more of the reasons why they believe and act as they do.I went on to download¬†The Girl Who Kicked the Hornet's Nest¬†on my Kindle immediately after finishing this one and I think I have to say that this second book was my favorite of the three.

Mary Wood,"Reviewed in the United States on September 27, 2011",,5.0 out of 5 stars,Unique writing style; not for everyone,"(NO MAJOR SPOILERS) This section of the trilogy, even more than the first book, rides completely on getting to know the personalities involved and how each one approaches the A-story. I'm seeing lots of complaints of too much exposition; I assume from those who require lots of action sequences to hold their attention. Instead, the suspense comes from what you know of the characters involved and how each one reads, or grossly misreads, the other. This one centers more around Salander than the first and we get many more glimpses into how she came to be the person that she is.As with the first book, if you're looking for lots of action this is not for you. It is however a fantastic psychological ride. What is this person going to do about X? How did that person react to Y? Once again, we get to know the personas not as much through what they're feeling, but more what they're thinking and doing. Definitely a unique writing style!To that end, I've been rather disappointed in the Sweedish versions of the films - Noomi Rapace's outstanding characterization not withstanding. Perhaps that is because the core plot, on its own, is not particularly unique as mysteries go. What gives this story its dimension is the exposition, which is difficult to work into a 2-hour film. This story most definitely works far better as a novel than as a movie.",,
A. Langston,"Reviewed in the United States on August 10, 2010",,5.0 out of 5 stars,A Cast Of Tens,"REVIEW OF THE AUDIOBOOK PRODUCTSimon Vance again keeps the story flowing, engaging and animated.  There are, at one point, over eight active characters in this book (I can't spell any of the names because I'm listening to the book not reading it but here goes: Michael, Salander, Erika, The Freelance Journalist Writing The Sex Trade Expose Book, The Criminologist Writing the Sex Trade Expose Thesis, Mariam Wu, Salander's former Guardian who had a stroke, Salander's sicko current Guardian, Armanski, the paranoid blonde giant) and Simon Vance gives EACH character his or her on voice and the voice sound authentic.  The female voices don't sound forced at all.  Their pitch and their flow seems totally in line with the character.  Vance is reading a book about Swedes in Swedish society in English and has decided to use English accents to delineate the characters (which is smart because I wouldn't know an ""Uptown"" Swedish accent from a ""ghetto"" Swedish accent but I can tell cockney from the King's English).  Even Salander's stroke victim former guardian sounds totally authentic.  I thought for sure Simon Vance doing a disabled person would sound forced but I was wrong.The CDs when ripped to Itunes have only minor problems.  The ""Album"" tag field for each CD is The Girl Who Played With Fire (DISC X), where X represents the CD number (1-15).  So if you want your digital media player to recognize all 15 CDs as being part of the same compilation you have to erase the ""(DISC X)"" from all the tags and you have to mark  the compilation box in all the tags.  When you get above CD 10 sometimes the actual Artist Name is also The Girl Who Played With Fire instead of Steig Larsson.

I have to say that I am the type of reader that loves to get LOST in a GOOD book, so that means I can get so carried away I can't stop reading. I started reading this book sometime Saturday morning and finally got to the last page sometime around 4 a.m. Sunday. It is a great read, though I would definately suggest that one reads the Girl with the Dragon tatoo first. This book is good but the first one ""the dragon tatoo ""is better.I would definately recommend these books, if you like a good detailed thriller. However to understand the protagonist Sulander alias the Wasp and Blomkzist you REALLY need to know what has happened before.A lot of the place names and first names are Swedish, so you have to make a rough guess at how they would be pronounced. These books are thrillers but one should realise that there is an underlying truth within the books about domestic, verbal and psychological and sexual abuse/violence towards women throughout, something which I think is interesting as one gets carried into the book without often realizing that the book has been written to bring awarenees to these issues, and leaves the reader with not just the feeling of having read a good thriller, but also leaves you thinking about the statistics that are mentioned throughout the books chapters.I will be on the list when the next and final Steig Larsson comes out in English translation... sometime 2010.",,

The cliffhanger ending left me dizzy with anticipation for the next part of the series, so my advice is don't finish this book until you have the next book ready to go!It is simply a shame that Larsson never got to realize the international success his books have become. It has been the most visible series of novels coming from Sweden since Pippi Longstocking, and the buzz it generates never seems to cease. And now with the movies, both the already made Swedish ones and the upcoming US version, Lisbeth has taken the world by storm.

The Tool Man,"Reviewed in the United States on April 4, 2011",One person found this helpful,4.0 out of 5 stars,"A touch of filler, a ton of excitement","This book certainly had it's share of jaw-dropping moments (one about 200 pages in, and another 200 pages after that, of which I will not spoil).  The author did a great job in not trying to recreate the first book, but to create a completely different path for his characters.  The first book was trying to unravel a 30 year old mystery, and this one deals very much in the ""here and now.""  The characters have picked up and advanced from the events of the first book, and not a bland recreation of themselves from the previous novel.  Furthermore, in this one, there are subtle setups to the 3rd book.My only detractors were that at times I feel as though the author was trying to pad the page count.  Lisbeth's encounter with a couple while on vacation didn't really do anything for the novel, per se.  It really only led to reminding us that she hates men who hates women.  This exposition could have been done in different ways.  With this changed, the first real reveal of the book wouldn't have happened 200 pages in, but maybe 150 pages in.  Or sooner!  Secondly, as the book unfolds, there seems to be a lot of summaries.  Blomkvist reading through his notes, or Salander remembering events, recreating notes found in the laptops, etc.  To what purpose, to remind the readers of what they are currently reading?  It seemed as tedious and a page-filler.Other than that, the book does have a faster pace than the first book, the progression of characters is strong and believable, and we get more of an insight into the life of Lisbeth Salander along the way - her background, why she is who she is, her motivations etc.  All told, very well done and a strong effort.",,
Schinnie,"Reviewed in the United States on September 10, 2010",,4.0 out of 5 stars,Not as good as the first one,"I think the second one is with better writing (or translating) compared to the first one, but the story itself is not as good in terms of suspense to the first book. The second book is all about Lisbeth Salander, which the author is apparently putting her as the center of the trilogy and unmasking her past to the readers. In a way I love the arrangement as in book one she just looks too mysterious and omnipotent to me. In this book I get to understand her better, all her flaws, weaknesses, and of course her amazing abilities which all linked to her past. However, I do think the story line is weaker in this one, with less suspense probably comes from the fewer characters. The first 100 pages are pretty much wasting of time if you ask me, and it didn't pick up the speed until Dag and Mia were murdered. And I think the book needs some serious editing too. I understand the author is trying to explain about Salander, why she's acting in certain ways and where she comes from, I get it. But he doesn't need to repeat himself for the 15th times. The reader is not that dumb! The constant repetition and going into unnecessary details (such as what Salander bought from 7-Eleven) is simply annoying, like we really care about each item she bought from the store. It's to the point of absurd if you ask me. The book can easily takes out some 200 pages if the editor does his/her job better.Even with all the flaws I still think this book is with some good efforts to continue from the first installment. I'll finish the last one and hopefully it can be fulfilling.",,

I wanted to believe the hype but unfortunately it was just not what I expected. If you have read the first one and find the characters interesting it might be worth the read to see where the story is going but at times it is slow going when the main characters only communicate through cryptic messages in hidden files.,,
MC Phillips,"Reviewed in the United States on April 21, 2014",,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Terrific, fast-moving thriller!","Like the first book in the ""Girl"" series, this one was tremendous fun to follow through its various twists and turns, and the main issue in the book - the female sex slave trade in Europe - is a topic well worthy of exploration (and derision, as the author demonstrates clearly).  That being said, the reader must really, really pay attention, because there are so many new characters introduced that it's very easy to forget who someone is, or confuse one character with another, and it's sometimes a little hard to keep up.  I also did not love that this book so clearly ends in such a way that you MUST read the next (and last) book in the series to get a finale.  I wish it were self-contained, like the first one, but I guess that's how you sell more books.  In short: If you enjoyed The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo, you'll love this, too - if you haven't read ""Tattoo"", don't bother, you'll be completely lost.",,
Abe Glaser,"Reviewed in the United States on June 14, 2015",,4.0 out of 5 stars,Lizbeth Salander is up to her old tricks again.,"A lot has been said about Stig Larsson's writing and I was happy to read this second book in the series.  I do not think he is easy to read in this translation and it is difficult to keep track of the characters.  Larsson fleshes them out well but his story drags on in the middle.  Lizbeth is cunning and dangerous as she was in The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo. The climax and ending are exciting and do tie up the story very well.One thing that bugs me is the author's lack of information about guns.  Larsson has researched his streets and medical information but he missed on the Colt .45.  There is no Colt .45 magnum.  The Colt comes in .45 Long Colt which is comparable to a .44 Magnum but not named so and falls short of the power.  I know, this is knit picking but it bugs me anyway.",,

Unfortunately, I do not think The Girl who Played with Fire met the same standard of excellence.In the 2nd installment to the Millenium Trilogy notable characters from the first book (Lisbeth, Mikael, Erika, etc.) combine with a slew new characters introduced in this book to create a story that ultimately has WAY too many characters.  There wasn't a single time when I picked up this book that I didn't have to back track quite a bit to remind myself who was who.  It got old and what made it even more difficult was the fact that a lot of new characters were indistinguishable in personality and back story but everyone had a particularly difficult Swedish name.  (An occasional ""Lars Nelson"" would've been a welcome reprieve in the memory game)The other problem is that this book has a lot of lose ends that go unaddressed as well as side stories that ultimately lead to nothing.  What I loved about the first book is that every single component to the story, no matter how far fetched, had some level of closure by the end.  The same level of satisfaction was not to be found here.  In fact, the ending is so abrupt I thought my kindle had broken or not downloaded the rest of the story.

Every thing known about her life is plastered in the papers, and exaggerated in the tabloids, she and all her known friends are laid bare and twisted into santanic worshiping dykes for the public to consume while drinking their morning coffee.Blomvist is friends of two of the victims who were journalist writing an in depth expose on the sex trafficking business in Sweden. They were trying to track down the elusive references to Zala. The very mention of him causes hardened men to shake. His secrets seem to lie hidden within the police files.Lisbeth is avoiding Blomvist and she is also looking for the evil Zala for reasons of her own. During her search she is kicking but and taking names (for future retribution I hope).I read this book on a Sunday, I literally could not put it down. It is very very suspenseful.

Then out of no where came Stieg Larson and stole the show.This book is not only well written, but the plots are awesome. Never have I seen a author put so much in his work. I wish he was alive to write many more, or even to continue with the storyline. His characters are simply divine. This is a book that once you pick it up, you will not want to put back down until you have enjoyed it to the last drop.This Trilogy slash Suspense novel is a one of kind. If anyone know of any other books he has written, please let me know because I will be getting them.The only draw back of this book for me was the cursing, remove those and this would be the best novel out there on the market.Spoiler: I enjoyed the scene where the hunt for Salander started and they thought this computer genius was a retard and a Satanist. When they found out the things she could do, like tackle two well known biker and felony, the entire police department was in total shock. When they saw the 5ft 90 pound girl, they stared at her as they remembered all that she had done.Just a superb story.

Jennifer Sandell,"Reviewed in the United States on November 23, 2009",One person found this helpful,3.0 out of 5 stars,A Solid Sequel,"I read this second book in the trilogy because I needed to find out what happens to Lisbeth Salander.  Typically crime novels and the like are not my favorite genre, but I was compelled to find out more about this troubled and scrappy heroine.  The plot centers around a story that Millenium publisher, Mikael Bloomkvist plans to publish about the sex slave trade and drug trafficking operations in Sweden.  The story really begins to heat up when the two main researchers/writers of this explosive expose are found murdered in their apartment and Lisbeth Salander's fingerprints are on the gun.  Bloomkvist stands alone in his belief that Salander is innocent (Even though she has been missing for a year or so).  Bloomkvist may know Salander better than anyone at this point because of their brief tryst during the first book and Bloomkvist's continued attempts to at least remain her friend.  For that reason, I have really grown to like Lisbeth Salander and I will continue to root for her.  This book took me a long time to read and I have to admit that I skimmed some of it because the book rambled on and on at times.  I was anxious to get back to Lisbeth's story.  I'm glad that in this book we find out more about her, what drives her.I look forward to the third book.  I'm sad that it will be the last one.",,

Bill Ellingsen,"Reviewed in the United States on August 20, 2010",,4.0 out of 5 stars,Lisbeth Salander - Super Girl,"Diminutive Lisbeth Salander (not even five feet tall and less than ninety pounds) has had a tough life, and it just keeps getting tougher. Even on the lam she runs across a nasty bastard intent on murdering his wife for her money. Lisbeth might be small but watch out, she's a wildcat; resourceful too. She could be a super-hero for battered wives everywhere. If not for managing to pilfer a fortune from unscrupulous villains she'd be a poor little orphan girl, even if she is technically a young woman. I feel for Lisbeth, and love the story except that nobody in it seems to be in a normal relationship. None are faithful lovers! I understand why Lisbeth is screwed up, but what's with the rest of these people? And it isn't just the men, although Lisbeth takes a lesbian lover, I think, because she understandably doesn't trust any men remotely her age. Of course I kept reading anyway. I had to know what happens to her. There was a minor technical problem that I must point out: A Colt .45 Magnum revolver? I don't think so. I'd believe .44 Magnum, though. And did the Swedish detectives really think someone of Lisbeth's stature could be proficient firing such a weapon? They kick like mules! Even Dirty Harry shot .44 Special ammo in his because of that reason. Aside from that, Lisbeth needs to buy her own Harley. I'm thinking, since she's so short, a Softail Deluxe. No!

Basically, Lizbeth's and Blomkwist sexual escapades which I believe were some fantasies of the author on paper.  It was TOTALLY unnecessary and was just ""filler"" and had no place in the story itself (not even for character development).  Once the mystery got started (around on the 5-6th CD if you do audio books), it started to get a little interesting.  I also do not like to the liberal political undertones.  They are quite small, but they are definitely there.  You can tell the author is from a socialist country and it spills into the story here and there (but not ""in your face"").  Finally, I was not expecting this to be a ""cliff hanger"", but that expalins the filler text in trying to stretch this out into three books.

In this 2nd installment, Lisbeth and Blomkvist tackle the sex trade industry. While I loved the first one, this one was much better. I felt I got to know both characters better and could better anticipate their actions and reactions. There is one more left and I am in no hurry to get. I'm dragging it out because I know there is only one more!This is one of those series that you hope never ends.My only warning would be for the faint of heart. This is sometimes almost like noir fiction--very dark and sexual. No cozy thriller, here; only dark thoughts, violent murders and sadistic sex crimes. The main character, Lisbeth, is truly one of the baddest I've ever seen! I would put my money with her battling the Terminator, Blade, Rocky---you name it. Even though it is difficult to connect with her, it is through her view of the world that you come to love her so much. The plot is one of those that just has you scratching your head the whole time--pure genius.I loved every word and plan to read them all again, just for the pleasure of reading Larson's work.

BooksHugBack,"Reviewed in the United States on August 5, 2010",One person found this helpful,4.0 out of 5 stars,So much better than the first!,"'The Girl who Played with Fire' is based solely on the back story of Lisabeth Salander who became a main character in the first novel.  A series of murder's takes place, and evidence at the crime scenes suggests that Salander is the main suspect.  Salander who is hiding out and hesitant to trust anyone, and her friends, the closest being the journalist Blomkvist, must use their personal investigating skills to put the pieces of the mystery together and locate the true villains.The plot in this book is a whole lot less involved than the first, which was one of my main complaints.  This one focuses on the interesting characters who I enjoyed so much during the first.  Salander is by far the most interesting, and the story dissects her past traumas and elusive family, and creates an elaborate description and rationale for her being and acting the way she does.  Her cunning actions and computer savvy abilities make the story all the more interesting as it jumps back and forth between all the characters who are searching for Salander and the answers to the murder mystery.  It is lengthy, but worth it this time. Too bad you have to get through the first one to enjoy the series.",,

James R. Gilligan,"Reviewed in the United States on September 27, 2010",,3.0 out of 5 stars,Middle child syndrome,"The second installment in the Millenium trilogy delves more deeply into the history of the title character, Lisbeth Salander. Larsson weaves an entertaining and complex tale of political intrigue, sexual perversion, and family dysfunction, but--as was the case with the first novel--the narrative is uneven and sometimes meanders as it attempts to find its identity. Part psychological character profile, part political thriller, part police procedural, part social critique, The Girl Who Played With Fire is a frustratingly inconsistent novel. For example, after one of the most dramatic and shocking moments in the book, Lisbeth Salander simply disappears from the story--I know this dramatic convention is intended to parallel the secrecy she must maintain as a result of the events in the story, but just when the action is at its most intense, Larsson chooses to dwell on the nuts-and-bolts details of the police investigation. Perhaps this novel simply suffers from middle-child syndrome, common among many middle books in literary trilogies--as the ending of this novel clearly indicates, its most important function is as a bridge to the concluding novel, The Girl Who Kicked the Hornet's Nest.",VINE VOICE,

By the time the ball gets rolling we are subjected to a slowly growing mystery surrounded by limp minded characters who struggle to figure it out. As a reader I was intrigued as to where it was going until I figured it out half way through. After that the fun was gone. The remaining pages lead into unsatisfactory action sequences developed without pretext.The question is, am I still entranced enough to find out where this could possibly go in the third book?

Yet Larsson hides from the reader key details about how Lisbeth became a suspect and whether she is guilty - we don't want to believe it, but there are these facts to consider. . . . Slowly the third person narrator takes the reader inside the heads of key players to reveal some - but not all - of Lisbeth's secrets as well as the hidden actions and motives of people all around her.Mikael Blomqvist returns to do what he can to defend his former lover, whom he believes to be innocent. Larsson sustains the tension in their relationship by almost but not quite bringing the two face-to-face throughout most of the book.While I know little about computer technology, I appreciate that Larsson included 21st Century technology in his plots.  In this era, I expect brilliant sleuths to use the Web but hope they won't get too technical or cross the line into the kind of computer science fiction I suspect I am seeing on some tv detective shows.  Lisbeth's skill as a hacker and user of gadgets manages to strike the right balance.This sequel does a good job of developing the terrific main characters from Larsson's ""The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo"".  Lisbeth is a fresh, tough and fascinating 21st Century woman and this book shows us some of the sources of her smart and skeptical nature. I look forward to learning more about her complex background and inner life in the next installment of the trilogy.

The first of the series was a bit over-technical for me, but still a good read that left me looking for more.  I was not at all disappointed in the sequel.  There was no particular techno-jargon, just good writing that held me until the end.  Although nearly twice as long as the first book, it took maybe half as long to read because of the lack of the aforementioned techno-jargon.  As in the first book, the dialogue was believable and its use added to the  the story.  ""The Girl Who Played With Fire"" is really a book about Lisbeth Salander than Michael Blomkvist, as is ""The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo.""  All the characters of Millenium are there except for old Henrik Vanger.  There is some continuity with Harriet Vanger, the heroine of the first book, taking a supporting role, but that part of the story is less believable.  The story opens with Lisbeth ending her travel around the world and returning to Stockholm.  The police are believably short-sighted and there are officers with agendas and prejudices as one would expect.  The ending sufficiently tied up the loose ends, but does leave one wanting for more.

To find two in a row is exceptional good luck, but this is the case when reading Stieg Larsson's The Girl Who Played with Fire right after finishing The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo. Both volumes classify as the best books of the year in my opinion. Larsson's writing is excellent, and the translation comfortable to read. His characters will go down in literature as outstanding. Just try to forget Lizbeth Salander! The manner of plotting both novels is fresh and clever and they flow together. Each can stand alone, but they blend so well, it adds to reading enjoyment to read them in sequence. I will leave the outlining details to the many other reviewers who have covered them well and simply conclude with the recommendation to beg, borrow, or buy (help the economy and booksellers) your copies, cancel any upcoming events on your schedule and prepare to be entertained, enlightened and educated for the period of time you will spend reading Larsson's work.

We learn more about Salander,and her parents but we are left hanging about her sister Camilla (maybe she will show up in part 3, the Hornets nest).  This fast moving multilayered thriller concerns a multiple murder investigation that is carried on by 3 parallel parties: the police, Blomkvist and Salander.  The complex areas where Salander intersects international espionage, official corruption, sex trafficking and Swedish politics is what makes this book tick.  The ending is rather abrupt and somewhat unbelievable - one learns that a Browning .22 does far less harm than a Sig Sauer and that hunting ammo is far more lethal than an ordinary bullet.  Larsson's books are among the best fiction books I have read.  I cant wait for the the final book and I am sorry that there wont be anymore due to the untimely death of the author.",,
Sean Sheikh,"Reviewed in the United States on February 8, 2012",,4.0 out of 5 stars,Great follow up to the first,"People familiar with¬†The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo (Movie Tie-in Edition) (Vintage Crime/Black Lizard)¬†or the movie, have undoubtedly looked up what's to follow in the series. The Girl Who Played with Fire is part two in the series, and follows beautifully.The books centers around a murder mystery involving the lead protagonist, Lisbeth Salander. Three people are found dead and the weapon shows Lisbeth's fingerprints. A cut and dry case? Maybe not.The book can be read without knowledge of the first; it gives a good background on each character. Although the first 200 pages or so are relatively calm, the book quickly speeds up. The mystery, story, and action are great. Most would agree it's more gripping than the first. Anyone looking for a great page-turner will be pleased.The movie rights have been confirmed by Sony which is intending a late 2013 release. Daniel Craig and Rooney Mara will continue their roles.",,

If the first book left you on the fence, take the plunge with this one, and you wont regret it.  If you didnt like the first book at all, well, why are you reading this review?There is no boring recitation of financial fraud, as in the first book, and there is a single unified plot, rather than two separate plots as in the first book.  It thus requires a lot less boring backstory, and the action, mystery, suspense, whatever you liked from the first book, picks up right away and keeps going.  The main characters from Girl with the Dragon Tatoo are here, and if you liked them there, you'll surely like them here.Last I checked, the first one had 4 stars, and this one had 4.5 stars over thousands of reviews.  I myself think the difference is even bigger than that, but there isnt much point in discussing it in detail.  If you liked the first book, just stop reading reviews and buy the second.",,

I read this book much more quickly than The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo and I really enjoyed the first book in the trilogy as well.  It's hard for me to tell whether that was because it was more exciting/engaging/suspenseful or if it was because I was more connected to the characters.  It was both frustrating and understandable that this book ended on more of a cliffhanger that indicated that it was very much going to be directly connected to the third book.  Frustrating because I wanted a more finite end to this book, like The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, but understandable because I could not wait to start the third book in the series (which I'm enjoying, but finding to be a little more difficult to fly through like I did with this one).  I would recommend this trilogy to someone who likes suspenseful, crime stories and is prepared to be invested in the entire lives of these characters by being prepared to read all three books.",,

Tattoo was a slow burn to a great climax, filled with textured characters and shifting suspicions. Fire is more of a roller coaster - lots of ups and downs, plenty of cheap thrills but not ultimately memorable. Returning characters have their impressive skills elevated to superhuman levels, requiring another degree of magnitude on the suspension-of-disbelief meter. The villain is more James Bond-ian than Hannibal Lechter-esque and the plot is overstuffed with extraneous characters and the kind of quick thrills that make me wonder whether he had hopes of a movie deal. Others have commented on his obsession with brand names and model numbers, which borders on silliness - he spends an entire page listing the models of IKEA furniture bought to outfit a new apartment. Nonetheless, this is better-written and than a typical pulp mystery, and much of it is simply hard to put down. Only disappointing, really, in comparison to the stronger earlier novel.",,

Incredibly compelling, though dark and sprinkled with occasional violence, which I don't usually go for. I went through the whole trilogy in a few weeks! But the writing transcended the violence, and the young tech savvy female protagonist is so well drawn as a modern underdog who unintentionally evolves to heroic stature over the series. The forces arrayed against her, that is, the modern state, through it's medical/psychological & legal establishment, are fierce and relentless, as is their nature.

Lisbeth Salander is a compelling protagonist, and this series is the ultimate female revenge story. The writing is solid, the plotting inspired, and the characterization (which may drive readers crazy because Larrson includes so MANY diverse characters) is expert. Readers who struggle with non-American pronunciations may be a bit overwhelmed at trying to ""hear"" the Swedish names and locations as they read, but I found myself working to try, just because I wanted to be that much more immersed in a great story! Another caution:  this book has some disturbing violence and a distinctly non-American view of sexuality, but its theme is the failure of governments and law enforcement in the area of sexual exploitation.  Sounds like strange magic, and it is. The final installment came out this week and I bought it!  How tragic for everyone that Steig Larsson died so young!",,

In this book, she is transformed into something of a female Rambo, which is only partially explained.To say that Ms. Salander is a fighter by nature is an understatement.

The reader does have to stay on top of the context as it takes place in a foreign country with unfamiliar locations and colloquial references but I think that makes it more interesting at the same time.  The plot for the 2nd book in the series is even better, possibly due to our familiarity with the characters and the reader has more investment in the story.

Marden H. Seavey,"Reviewed in the United States on March 30, 2010",One person found this helpful,5.0 out of 5 stars,Exciting to the end,"I finished this book by Stieg Larsson several days ago and it was exciting to the end, unlike the first book in the series which was not so exciting in the last few chapters after the main mystery had been unraveled, but was still extremely interesting. There are a number of riddles in the second book that get solved as the end is approached. You are kept in suspense, especially about what will happen to the main character, Lisbeth Salander, right up to the last page. Her closing words made me laugh and then made me wonder what will come next. For that I'll have to wait for the third and final book in the series.One way to describe this book is as an interaction of extreme personalities with a society that is both baffled and corrupt. The extreme personalities are three. First, the girl, Lisbeth Salander is a complete genius who has been terribly mistreated but retains high moral principles in spite of her bizarre behavior. Second, there is an enormous hulk, called the blond giant, who deals out extreme punishment to those who are disapproved of by his master. Third, there is the master himself, a twisted but brilliant schemer who controls an underground of murderous thugs and is not seen until near the end of the book.The good guy is again Mikael Blomkvist who works tirelessly to solve the riddles and help Lisbeth even though for awhile he's not sure of her innocence. Perhaps the author in real life gave Mikael his own personality and that is why he had the unfortunate heart attack at the age of 50 from overwork.Then there is the rest of the society, the magazine where Mikael works whose beautiful publisher is having an ongoing affair with him, the security agency with its thoughtful director who Lisbeth has done jobs for, the police department, ever confused about how to interpret what's happening, with its good guys and bad guys, the subculture of the sex trade which has its tentacles into mainstream society. Yes, it's a complex mix of personalities and culture showing the nasty and hypocritical underbelly of that seemly well ordered Swedish society. But most of all it's an exciting detective story that keeps you in suspense through to the very last page!",,

I don't read a lot of foreign authors because I feel I'm missing something as far as the specific cultural references.  For instance, referring to neighborhoods in a particular city -- if an American novel, set in New York City, states ""she used to live in Brighton Beach, but now she lives on the upper east side,"" I understand what that connotes.  If it's said about two neighborhoods are in Copenhagen, I have no idea what that signifies.  I ran up against a little of that in this book...it makes me feel like I didn't get it, one hundred percent.  It's my basic problem with non-US-based literature.

The book starts off with so many questions and slowly answers them but it is really engaging and you find yourself being the detective, trying to piece together the clues and solve what happened.

It is her relationship with her father, her friends and Blomkvist, how these relationships play out and mature.

If the scene didn't involve Lisbeth, I found myself anxious to move on through the less interesting parts (a lot of detail) to get back to her.  Also, I feel that Lisbeth would never, ever consider getting breast augmentation. Such a procedure could be construed that she was lacking in some way because she had small breasts. Uh? Sorry to you five-star fans, but I believe the author's own anatomical preferences and sexual fantasies may have sent an unwilling Salander to the plastic surgeon.  I think little Lisbeth with a big attitude would have said, ""If they don't like me the bleeping way I am, then bleep them!""

I've never met a character like Lisbeth Salander, who seemed to be the target of everyone, in her predicament (and that's putting it very lightly), but is so unconcerned.  Total nonconformist with a photographic memory and the ability to hack into almost anyone's computer or computer system, she has her own ways to protect herself.The narrative keeps us current with Lisbeth and Mikael Blomkvist, who are connected by a friendship from the first book.  Lisbeth has ended it in her mind and heart, but Blomkvist cares about her, and, unknowing to her, is working to find her and protect her.  How it all works, while drawing you into other plots and other character's lives will make it hard to put down.Read Book 1.

The story picks up where TGWTDT left off, and once it got going, it was decent. I like Blomkvist and Salander's characters, even if Salander is a little unbelievable at times with regard to her self-preservation capabilities.

The characters continue to develop and I found that I got to know them even better by the end of the book.  I did have to read this book a bit more carefully than I might have others because the plot did get a bit involved.

Another quirky page-turner from Mr. Larsson. His characters (especially Lisbeth) are fleshed out even further in this book, and full of surprises. I will admit that the math discussions went right over my head--so I don't know if there was any connection between those and the structure of the plot, but it at least showed yet another facet of Lisbeth's personality.

Now with the two follow-up stories and the Swedish movie versions, I felt I needed to own the whole series and reread them again. The first book in the series is The Girl Who Played With Fire, and I have to admit, it took me a while to get into this book, but once I did, I was IN. I wanted to know more and the character of Lizbeth Salander, who she is, why she is the way she is, and what makes her tick. Without revealing spoilers, she's a character who's been knocked about but keeps getting back up, and a character I want to know more about. Thank goodness Stieg Larsson wrote two more books featuring Lisbeth Salander, one other of which I've read, and the third which I've pre-ordered. Also, the first movie coming out of Sweden for this book was very very faithful to the book and to the characters. Noomi Rapace IS Lisbeth Salander and I think it's a shame that instead of promoting these Swedish sub-titled movies, the US feels like they need to make their own versions. I'm from the US, I can and don't mind reading subtitles.",,

In the circles of my youth, a lesbian punk with a violent streak wouldn't have been considered that unusual, and I'm a bit surprised that she has such mainstream appeal. I guess times have changed.I'm not sure why Larsson felt this compulsion to focus on her domestic routines, and what she shopped for, etc. I would have edited that stuff out.The plot twist that takes place after the first third(?) of the book really was a shocker, and it defines the rest of the story. Safe to say that Lisbeth gets in quite a bit of trouble. For much of the time, she isn't even in the narrative, you just have other characters talking about her. It's fascinating how long Larsson is able to sustain this approach.To be honest, the secret behind the narrative is a bit more conventional than what one finds in ""Dragon Tattoo."" It's worthwhile reading, but it's a bit more like the typical malfeasance-in-high-places that has been done equally well elsewhere. There are plenty of thriller action movies that have plots that are more sinister and conspiratorial. Unlike ""Dragon,"" when the mask is finally stripped and the characters reveal the true nature of their plotting and their fundamental nature, you're not shocked. It's more like tidying up. I wish that Larsson could have spent more time coming up with something a bit more earth-shaking and scary.However, the character of Lisbeth Salander makes up for these drawbacks. It's funny how you find yourself rooting for someone whom so many other characters in the book consider a dangerously unbalanced individual. It's definitely worth investing your time. Ten bucks for the hardcover is a screaming good deal. I'm glad that Larsson wrote these books, and I'm certainly going to read the third one. So obviously, he must have done something right.",,

A subset of the Trilogy is the revealing troubles beneath the wonderful, peaceful facade that Sweden presents to the world. There are evil undercurrents and these are the things Mikael Blomkvist pursues as a journalist.

That and many of the central characters had names similar enough to be confusing at times.  This book tends to focus on the characters (particularly Salander) more than the actual mystery, so I didn't find it the page turner that Dragon was.

James Barton Phelps,"Reviewed in the United States on February 20, 2012",9 people found this helpful,1.0 out of 5 stars,Pulp Fiction,"There is absolutely no need for another ""review"" of this book. As of this writing 1,480 of you have already written one  and this will be number 1481. Why? Well, call it what you will, but having just seen the American film version of ""Girl With The Dragon Tattoo"", I was reminded of the fact that I had read this book (Fire) when it was published three years ago and never really ""got "" it. So after seeing the movie I picked the book up again and read it again  to see whether I could make any more literary sense of it now than when I read it then.. Having done so, and having given it the benefit of the doubt, the verdict is still about the same. There are too many moving parts. The book may be a part of a literary phenomenon but it is still literary trash, stuff for the pulps. Not only is the action hard to follow it's fiction right out of Adventure Magazine. Readers of Dragon Tattoo will remember how that story ended: Blomkvist had been empowered by Henrik Vanger with the information to ""take down"" the financier Wennerstrom. He had done just that and gained fame by publishing his book on the Wennerstron financial scandal. At the same time Lisbeth Salander had on her own and independently ""taken down"" Wennerstrom's financial empire to the tune of three billion kroner, all of which she then deposited safely in her own Swiss Bank accounts and disappeared. And now as The Girl Who Played With Fire begins, it is year later. Salander has dropped out of sight - intentionally - and she is sitting on the beach in Granada reading Dimensions In Mathematics by Dr. L.C.Parnault (Harvard University Press 1999) - There is no such book - She still has the body of a 12 year old plus the Dragon Tattoo, but she has cleaned up her act. Most of her Goth-like appearance - piercings, tattoos etc. - has been removed and a Swiss plastic surgeon has given her bra-deserving breasts. Yet she is still the same Slander with an uncompromising black or white view of the world. Things are either right or wrong, never in between Her unique talents are unimpaired - a photographic memory, exceptional hacker skills, her temper, her cobra like quickness to attack, defend or escape and all her enviable martial arts. Her qualities of love, sensitivity, tenderness and humanity still exist but also lie still mummified within her. Her tragedy is that she cannot really love nor express much love - if any. There is a hurricane which pretty well destroys the hotel where she has been staying for weeks; so, using the disguise under which she has been traveling (Irene Nasser from Norway), she returns to Stockholm, purchases a luxurious apartment and starts to contemplate her future. But it turns out there's little time for that. Her fingerprints are found on a gun used to murder three people - Nils Bjurman, Salander's old guardian and deadly enemy, and two nice young researchers who were preparing an expose for Millennium on the crimes of human trafficking in young girls from the Baltic States and Russia. Immediately she becomes a most wanted woman. She goes to ground. And the action starts. Three investigations start independently and for different reasons. The first, obviously, is the official Police Investigation. Then there is the Armansky investigation commenced by her old employer Dragan Armanski of Milton Security and who has the feeling that she has been set up. And finally there is the  Blomqvist/Millenium investigation carried out by Blomqvist and employees of Millenium - which needs a bit of background. (Having discovered that Salander is back Blomqvist has tried unsuccessfully to get in touch. She has resisted. But he still cares very much for her and wants to help her out of her problem if he can. The, too, the two young people who were killed were in essence working in tandem with the Millenium staff and hence both Blomqvist and Millenium have a substantial interest in justice being observed; and they enter into the investigation with purpose - Blomqvist himself far ahead of the pack.) It would have ben best for the author to have stopped here and proceeded with a straight out whodunit, because if there are three investigations running contemporaneously and if there are related events happening in each it is difficult for any author to introduce them serially - which he has to do because he's writing in the narrative. The reader has to jump from the events in one investigation to another and remember what was in the first and how it was or is related to the second etc. But that doesn't happen. Then, on top of this problem of narrative, Larssen introduces a new stand-alone story - Salander's life as a juvenile in Sweden's juvenile justice system plus her experiences as the object of a trumped up finding that she is a danger to herself and others which has led to a year in restraints in a psychiatric ""care"" center at the instance of crooked psychiatrists with a real reason to lie. There is a third story interwoven here too  - about Salander's real father, his background as a Soviet agent and the concealment of his identity by the highest echelons of Swedish security officialdom, all of which leads to chain saw violence, biker violence, plain physical violence, torture and arson - to name just a few of the complications Complicating things even further is the fact that Larsson wrote in Swedish in Sweden for Swedish readers. All of his characters have Swedish surnames, a fact which poses no problem for his Swedish audience, but they read so similarly in English it's hard for an English reader to keep their identities separate. Anther problem; He wrote in Stockholm about characters in Stockholm and about places in Stockholm or nearby: the locale is Stockholm and environs. If you are Swedish you will be able to follow the action geographically, but if you're not you get lost.  (Even with the aid of a good Atlas and constant resort to my Google Earth app I couldn't follow the action geographically.) Bottom line. There are too many moving parts. Larsson has tried to tell too many stories in one book and the reader is left baffled and unrequited. It could have been a better book. It's still out of Adventure Magazine whose editors would have cleaned it up and selected one good narrative out of all the material crammed between these 501 pages. Too bad.",,

Scenery, scenario and 'adjective play' make sequences come to life with suspenseful continuity.

Young,"Reviewed in the United States on April 19, 2011",,3.0 out of 5 stars,A lot of un-necessary story lines,"I liked this book and the ending leaves you jumping directly into The Girl Who Kicked the Hornet's Nest. But it seemed to me like there were too many other stories taking place that had nothing to do with the main plot. The book starts with Lisbeth being at a resort and her obsession with a doctor and his wife who are vacationing at the same resort. Her observation of this doctor and his behavior keeps you interested. However, that story is short lived, Lisbeth ends her travel, goes back to the real world and that is where the real story takes off. There is never any mention of the doctor and his wife after Lisbeth returns to Sweden. What ever happened to her friend George Bland? Why were these characters ever introduced? There also seemed to be way too many characters. There were also characters whose names were similar: Erica, Erikson and Ekstrom. For a while, I thought we were going to learn more aobut Officer Modig. There was a little mention of her personal life, then her role came to a halt. I noticed the same in The Girl Who Kicked the Hornet's Nest. In that book, it seemed like the book took an intermission mid-way through and all of a sudden, I was reading a new book about Erica Berger and her position at SMP and her stalker. That was resolved, then it went back to Lisbeth's saga. What in the world was the point of Berger's storyline? I did like all the books and I assumed they were supposed to be about Lisabeth Salander. I just didn't understand why the books were so long, full of insignificant stories.",,
A Distant Relative,"Reviewed in the United States on February 11, 2010",One person found this helpful,4.0 out of 5 stars,One Character Carries the Book,"Stief Larsson's novels revolve around the character of Lisbeth Salanter, and every scene that doesn't involve her is flat or simply a set-up for her actions later. I'm not sure I understand the immense attraction of the Millennium series except to experience the wasp-quick domination and slyness Lisbeth suddenly has at key moments. The Girl Who Played with Fire is apparently titled after an incident involving Lisbeth as a girl, and it comes so quickly in the book it takes your breath away. But the story line itself and its revealed relationships are, to this reviewer, clumsy. The book has contradictory effects and is imbalanced, yet no one can argue that the eerie attraction of Lisbeth  redeems the story line.",,

I think I liked this one even better. We again meet with journalist Mikael Blomkvist and Lisbeth Salander, one of the greatest new characters in fiction. She has a photographic memory, serious computer skills, and her own version of morality.It is a year later and we start with Lisbeth travelling around the world and Blomkvist meeting with a journalist to publish a series of explosive articles and a book on the sex trade in Sweden, one that will expose many high profile people involved. When Lisbeth returns to Sweden, though she isn't speaking to Blomkvist, as she is upset at the end of an affair they had, she keeps track of what he's up to by hacking into his computer. She reads the research that has been done on the sex trade and recognizes a name. She contacts the journalist and his girlfriend, who's graduate thesis started the investigations, and then they turn up murdered. Lisbeth's prints are on the murder weapon, she is the prime suspect and her life is played out on the front pages of every newspaper.In The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo, the story was mostly Blomkvist's, though we met and got to know a bit about Lisbeth Salander. But The Girl Who Played With Fire is most definitely Salander's story. Things we learn about Lisbeth in the first book, her psychiatric history, mysterious past, her expert computer hacking skills, and her barely existent social skills, are front and center in this sequel. Salander's slimy legal guadian from the first novel is back and wants revenge against her. Salander frequently refers to a period in her past as ""All the Evil "" which is not explained until near the end. Many questions raised in the first book about Salander are answered in this one. Blomkvist is determined to help Salander and she is determined to do things on her own.Larsson crafts a great plot, though I felt the middle slowed a bit, when it is focused on the investigation by the police and Salander is absent from the story during this period. But then it picks up fast, as we follow the seperate investigations, one by the police, another by Blomkvist and other allies of Salanders, and the one by Lisbeth herself. The intricate story keeps the reader intrigued until the very end when they all merge together. This book was well worth what seemed to be an incredibly long wait, and now I am again waiting, this time for The Girl Who Kicked the Hornet's Nest. I highly recommend this book but you need to have read The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo to fully appreciate this sequel. Enjoy![...]",VINE VOICE,
Bobbewig,"Reviewed in the United States on July 2, 2010",6 people found this helpful,3.0 out of 5 stars,Entertaining But A Big Disappointment Compared To The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo!,"When I finished reading The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo I couldn't wait to start The Girl Who Played With Fire. Having now finished this second installment in the trilogy, I was disappointed in it and won't be in a hurry to read the final book in the series, which will remain in my bookcase for awhile. One reason for my  disappointment stems from the fact that while the book's plot was interesting, the author let the book get bogged down in too much detail which never allowed the story to build up a full head of steam. As such, I found it dragged throughout large passages of the book. For me, The Girl Who Played With Fire, would have been much more enjoyable if it wasn't bloated with probably 100-200 pages that were not much more than filler. A second big source of my disappointment stems from the book being filled with too many secondary characters that either had little importance to the story or were cartoon-like. In particular, I found Larsson's ""bad guys"" to be too one-dimensional and lacking in credibility. A third disappointment was that little of the mystery in this book was solved by clever investigative work by the police or others involved in the case, which would helped build a greater sense of excitement and suspense. Instead, too much of the solving of the case depends on super-woman's, Lisbeth Salander's, ability to hack into even the most sophisticated computer systems in order to obtain information she needs. A fourth source of disappointment is Larrson's leaving too many of the sub-plots in the book without any resolution. It's as if he lost interesting in them along the way and hoped that the reader wouldn't mind being ""left hanging."" But my biggest source of dissatisfaction is the book's preposterous ending that had me cringing a bit from it's ridiculousness. Overall, despite these sources of disappointment,The Girl Who Played With Fire, was an entertaining book; but it could have been a very good one with some serious editing.",TOP 1000 REVIEWER VINE VOICE,
ellen qian,"Reviewed in the United States on January 8, 2012",,4.0 out of 5 stars,"if you are a suspended thriller book lover, this is a must read","As a second book of the trilogy, it is not as excited as the first one 'the girl with the dragon tattoo' and not the last one to finish all the leads and stories appeared before. However, it does open a new world for  readers after the discussion on the Nazi and religious theme, which is the corrupted government, the illegal immigrant involved in the sex trafficking, the unfairness to the woman who suffered from domestic violence and slightly criticism to the public education system.The structure of this book looks slightly loosen because ten groups of people involved in the sex trafficking and murders: Salander, Svesson and Johasson, Bjurman, Millenium group, Police, Milton Security, Bjork, Palmgren, Paolo Roberto and Miriam Wu, and finally Zala. The scenario always jumped free from one group to another and sometimes I almost forgot what Salander did in the previous scenario but the author is good at the scenario transition as he often briefly mentioned the last action of a role in the new scenario.The reason that the book made me fall in love is that the author is good at controlling the pace to tell his story. And more importantly, as a woman, I admire and appreciate Salander's attitude toward all the evil(not only that specific event but all the bad things) happened on her, which is independent, brave, smart and never give up.If you are a suspended-thriller reader, this one is a must read.",,

When I was finished I was ready and really wanted to read the third novel. I recommend this novel highly. As with the first novel, there are mature subjects and graphic sex and violence.

demac,"Reviewed in the United States on November 12, 2010",One person found this helpful,4.0 out of 5 stars,Better than volume one,"I was unsure whether to continue this trilogy after reading ""The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo"".  While I thought that book was OK, its odd pacing and meandering focus was a little off-putting to me.  I never understood the reviews that described it as impossible to put down.  But, I am really glad I forged ahead.  ""The Girl Who Played with Fire"" is so good, that I found that I even appreciated the first book more after reading this one.Largely, that is because while Lisbeth Salander is the title character in all these books (at least the English versions), and while she is by far the most interesting character, she really is not that central in the first volume.  But, now she moves center stage, and becomes an even more interesting character as we understand her better, as well as watch her evolve.But, besides this advantage, this installment in the trilogy does a better job of leading the reader through the mystery solving.  I felt that in ""Dragon Tattoo"" a lot of time was spent talking about how unsolveable the mystery was, and then rather quickly wrapping it up.  Here, you get to follow the investigators as they struggle to make sense of the various bits of information they come across, and can share their confusion when all the pieces don't fit as expected, until ultimately the whole picture becomes clear.And finally, while there was one horrendous villain in volume one (who seemed to just sort of pop out of nowhere), here there are a bevy of shady characters that we encounter through much of the book, with some interesting quirks themselves.There is one plot device toward the end that is just not believable, but that quibble does not spoil what is otherwise a great action/mystery story coupled with terrific development of one of the most interesting characters I have encountered.As to reconsidering my opinion of volume one, I see now that it actually did a pretty good job of setting the stage for what comes next.  So, while ""Played With Fire"" can stand alone, I think I enjoyed it more as a result of having read ""Dragon Tattoo"" first.I've seen some reviews that complain that ""The Girl Who Played With Fire"" ends with too much of a cliffhanger, but I did not find that to be the case.  While there are obvious opportunities for a sequel, I thought the conclusion of this volume was quite satisfying.",,

Mr. August,"Reviewed in the United States on September 14, 2009",One person found this helpful,5.0 out of 5 stars,"4 Months, 4 Parts, 3 Murders, 1 Brilliant Salander","I have never encountered another character as multi-layered and brilliant as Lisbeth Salander.  I first met her in Larsson's previous novel, The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo.  She was a flat-chested, waif-like teen who was a gifted computer and mathematical genius.  In this novel, she is a more overt genius but she now has breasts, which she paid for with funds from an ambiguous, illicit source. She is accused of three murders and the investigation promises to keep the reader on the edge.Larsson's novel captures the essence of social problems in Sweden, this one centering around the sex trade. Portrayed by extreme characters, we encounter the absolute misery and decadent behavior toward females.  Mikael Blomkvist, the good guy from the first novel, has uncovered information on the subject and plans to disclose the subject in an issue of his own magazine, Millennium.  Lisbeth becomes the savior of abused women.  She is also an extremist, many of the characters are ensconced in fanatical escapades.Blomkvist and Salander had a previous sexual relationship which forced Lisbeth to bury any romantic feelings and so she refuses to allow Blomkvist to contact her.  Based on her past, Lisbeth is comfortable leading a paripatetic life, with no solid relationships.  She trusts no one.  One of most vile characters is her guardian, Bjurman, who made a horrendous mistake when he sexually took advantage of Lisbeth.  Her revenge is harsh and connects the story. His attempts at revenge are proof that she is very, very smart.I understand that this book is the second of the trilogy and the last book may provide some closure, but I believe that Larsson keeps the reader dangling with many unanswered questions.  Larsson was too critical of the society he describes to have it tie up in a neat little package.",VINE VOICE,
Diana Faillace Von Behren,"Reviewed in the United States on September 26, 2009",One person found this helpful,4.0 out of 5 stars,4 Alarm-er,"Author Stieg Larsson successfully follows up his first installment of the Millenium trilogy, ""The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo (Vintage),"" with a glimpse of the eponymous Lisbeth Salander's sad and misunderstood past in ""The Girl Who Played With Fire,"" a page-turner that keeps the reader entertained and begging for more right until the heroine utters her very last relieved and happy yet slightly cynical acknowledgment of sidekick Mikael Blomkvist's presence.The two main characters, introduced and thrown together during the solving of the disappearance of Harriet Vanger in the first novel, don't share much page-time together in this second installment.  Blomkvist, basking in his triumph over the Wennerstrom group, moves on in his regrouping of his financial magazine to prepare for his publishing coupe of the year: the release of both a book and full edition article on underage prostitution written by a notable journalist and his PhD candidate wife.With her trademark anger and disgust over her emotional love/attachment for Blomkvist, Salander refuses her love further entry into her life.  Always fiercely independent, now, after absconding millions in an exacting act of retaliation from Wennerstrom's private funds, she needs never to work again.  But old habits die hard, she cannot help but `tap into' the lives of those she both loves and hates with her incredible computer hacking skills and the ability to mete out punishment with the dreaded vigilance and potentially lethal retribution of a technologically savvy Erinye.  While in the midst of not leaving her digital fingerprint on Blomkvist's computer, she comes across a name in one of his files that resonates deeply from her past.  Her quest for a connection leads to a triple killing--the journalist, his wife and Dragon Girl's own despicable guardian, Nils Bjurman-whom the reader has learned to hate from the first novel.  When her physical fingerprints on the murder weapon link her to the crimes, uber survivor Salander furrows underground even deeper as a full-scale manhunt begins with an even fuller albeit skewed disclosure of her sad history with Sweden's social services.Author Larsson drives his plot from alternating third person vantage points that give the reader a generalized perspective from a specific corner of the various stratums of Swedish life.  We are privy to varying degrees of freedom as demonstrated by the social class exhibited by Larsson's variety of characters; we can actually feel the weight of burden placed upon certain undesirables by the social infrastructure--the skin of which Larsson (now deceased but also a one-time investigative crusader not unlike his main character Blomkvist) obviously enjoys perforating and exposing for its inability to defend the rights of over half the population it is in existence to protect.  As Blomkvist rallies to prove Salander's innocence, Larsson expertly flips the scene from one exploited social group to another--urbane journalists, world-weary police, underhanded social workers, sex trade veterans, bisexual punk divas and in a group of her own, hacker extraordinaire, primo victim of the system, his murderously vulnerable Girl with the Dragon Tattoo. He creates a wonderful compendium of facts and activities that entertain with a purpose the reader is not likely to forget.Like all such novels, this one relies on circumstances and coincidences that of course pull the book together as a novel with a beginning, middle and an end. Nonetheless, no matter how thug-like I found the gangster-like repartee at times, it works.  Readers will not be disappointed--as this tale unravels it reveals moments of evil and violence that rival in their chilling efficiency and inhumanity the workings of Thomas Harris's Hannibal Lector as he sprang in all his twisted glory on the horror/thriller literary scene in¬†The Silence of the Lambs (Hannibal Lector). Larsson actually refreshes a genre that in its blatancy immunized readers to the horror or actual life.Bottom line:  Stieg Larsson's ""The Girl Who Played With Fire"" gives those fans of ""The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo"" a huge book with more Blomkvist/Salander adventures.  Focusing on the exoneration of Salander for present day murders that link to her past, the reader is in for a treat as some crucial information about her personal history is revealed in the denouement.  Great read and satisfying second installment.  Some sly critique of Sweden's social services from Larsson's perspective and many gruesome examples of man's abusiveness towards objects of control.

But then you've got to wade through about 140 pages of ""Dragon Tattoo"" recap and kinky sex history of the cast - yeah, Stieg, we get it - Sweden is sexually liberated - before hunkering down to the really good stuff.  But trust me, this is a small price to pay as the prelude to the remaining 340 pages of over-the-top thrills and suspense, a rockin' and rolling mystery that would make the Vikings proud, a smorgasbord a violence and head games wrapped around the most interesting protagonist to hit the pages since, well, ""The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo.""That would be Lisbet Salander, the damaged genius created by the late Stieg Larsson for stopped too soon at a trilogy - the pierced and tattooed misfit with an extreme distaste for misogynists, a healthy disrespect for authority honed by years of institutional abuse, and a deliciously bad attitude.  In this installment, the author metes out in frustratingly small doses the brutal baggage that created the flawed brilliance of Salander, a cleverly - if improbably rendered- female combination of Kevin Mitnick, Bruce Lee, and Ozzie Osbourne.  Following the Blomkvist-Salander team that broke the decades-old Vanger mystery of ""Tattoo"" and Salander's subsequent heist of  corrupt industrialist Hans-Erik Wennerstrom which has left her financially independent, Blomkvist and his ""Millennium"" magazine take on a freelance journalist and his expose of a Eastern Europe-to-Sweden prostitution ring that catches a lot of pols and cops in high places with their pants around their ankles.  But when the researchers end up with bullets in their heads, fired from a gun with Salander's prints all over it, a frenzied media and biased prosecution team have all of Sweden looking for a slandered Salanader as the obvious perp.  But an eventually skeptical cop and the faithful Blomkvist stand by their maverick, setting up an over-the-top, sometimes poignant, mostly unbelievable, but always entertaining shock-lit romp through Europe's frozen playground of the north, never pausing long enough to note the irony in the tyranny of Sweden's social utopia theory against an all too real backdrop of heavy-handed state control which put poor Salander in her predicament in the first place.  Larsson zigs and zags through a number of unexpected twists and turns, through lots of stops in 7-11 (is Swedish cuisine so bad that 7-11 is really a preferred dining spot?) leading to the most white-knuckled climax since Josh Bazell's Dr. Peter Brown pulls a fibula in the frenzied ""Beat the Reaper"".Paradoxically, Larsson does not read like stoic fatalism of Scandinavian kin Irdridason, Fosset, or Nesbo, but rather more like the raucous, unapologetic, and graphically violent prose of Charlie Huston, Duane Swierczynski, or Adrian McKinty - high praise from this reviewer.  Yet Larsson has some axes to grind - violence against women, corruption, social injustice - but does so tastefully without beating the reader into submission with misguided indignities.  He wraps his thriller around a clever mathematical theme, adding to the depth and intelligence of a well-crafted novel that entertains on the surface with raw adrenaline, while satisfying less visceral emotions at a deeper level.  It is a shame that Stieg Larsson is no longer around to continue this refreshing and creative series, but I'll anxiously await the English release of  the final chapter in ""The Girl Who Kicked the Hornet's Nest.""",,

If you haven't read The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, don't even think about buying this book. Don't even read the reviews. One small bit of information will ruin the entire plot for you. If have read the first novel, then prepare yourself because The Girl Who Played with Fire will blow you away.The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo focused on the disappearance of Harriet Vanger, but this novel focuses on Lisbeth Salander. Who she is. Where she came from, and more importantly why she was declared incompetent and placed in a mental institution.The novel picks up a year after the Vanger events. Lisbeth decided to travel around the world for a while. Mikael Blomkvist tries to contact her, but it's like Lisbeth has fallen off the face of the earth. So it seems!Meanwhile, Mikael is back at Millennium when a scoop that involves corruption at the highest levels of government is offered to him. However, before Mikael can publish a book exposing a sex scandal that involves, police officers, judges, lawyers, and goverment officials, two shocking murders take place. The main suspect is Lisbeth Salander. The Girl with Dragon Tattoo becomes the most wanted woman in Sweden. Her fingerprints were found on the weapon, and everyone believes she is guilty of murder, except for Mikael.I read The Girl who Played with Fire with bated breath. I expected to be slightly disappointed because I didn't think it was possible for a sequel to top The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo. I was wrong! I actually think this novel is slightly better than the previous novel. In the first book, I had a strong suspicion about what happened to Harriet Vanger. In this novel, I didn't have the slightest clue how or why Lisbeth Salander was mixed up the double murders.As in The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, there are many characters in this book. This is usually a strike against a book. Too many characters usually takes away from the main storyline, but Stieg Larsson made it work his first novel and did it again in The Girl who Played with Fire. Prepare to meet many police officers, detectives, journalists, and criminals.The author's untimely death is so tragic. He was a gifted writer and would have become one of my favorite authors of all time. If you haven't already, you must read both books written by this author.

J. Grattan,"Reviewed in the United States on September 13, 2009",,4.0 out of 5 stars,Lisbeth Salander as the hunted this time (4.5*s),"This book continues with the story of twenty-six-year-old Lisbeth Salander, first introduced in ""The Girl with the Dragoon Tatto."" She is surely one of most interesting and strange characters introduced in crime fiction in recent years with her reclusive, punk, misfit motif but with computer and survival skills off the chart, especially for someone officially declared as incompetent and in need of state-mandated guardianship. She has changed some from her days of working as a researcher for journalist Carl Blomkist in his search for a woman missing some forty years. Secondarily in the first book, she parlayed her computer skills to rake off a small fortune from the ill-gotten gains of Swedish industrialist Hans Wennestrom before his exposure and has thereby bettered her living circumstances with no less care being given to anonymity.But life takes a dramatic turn for the worse for Salander when she is identified as the prime suspect in the murder of three individuals: her guardian, a freelance journalist Dag Svensson, and his roommate Mia Johansson, a sex researcher, which conveniently fits with her diagnosis of being capable of psychotic, violent behavior. Svensson was on the verge of publishing an expose of sex-trafficking in Blomkist's magazine Millennium with many leading Swedish citizens on the list. But what was the connection of Salander to the journalist and/or the sex-business and how was her guardian involved with all of this?The book is a fast-paced, though lengthy, unraveling of these complications. A lot of missteps are taken by Swedish police, some more well-intentioned than others. There is a contradiction from the start for the authorities: Blomkist and others familiar with Salander speak of her extraordinary intelligence and sense of morality, which hardly squares with the psychiatric evaluations. Salander has to walk the tightrope of avoiding capture or arrest while being proactive in proving her innocence. It turns out that much of her past, both recent and early, pertains. The enigmatic Lisbeth is slowly revealed adding credibility to her bizarre personality, as well as moving towards a conclusion.A reading of the first book is not totally necessary to fully appreciate this book, though it would be helpful. The cautious attraction of Blomkist and Salander that got sidetracked by the end of the first book is in a deep freeze, but this case has the potential for changing all of that. Salander needs allies, and Blomkist is at the top of the list.Perhaps the Swedish names can be a distraction, but the real story is about human interactions, not names of places. This second book of a three-part series is as good as the first - perhaps better. The writing is sharp - not just of the characters but of the scenarios in which Blomkist and Salander find themselves. One could nitpick the plot with its coincidences, implausibilities, loose ends, and the like. But the reason to read the book is to watch Lisbeth Salander in action. And there are remaining issues for book three.",VINE VOICE,

Its deeper character study of Salander is intriguing, but is more of a straightforward detective novel than the first with its multi-storied approach (Harriet Vanger, the Vanger family secrets, and Wennstrom stories all coming together to multiple conclusions).By contrast, this one seems to leave off after one mystery is solved, but with a central character still in crisis. That indicates the third book continues with this story. It's certainly well-written and paced, but not as satisfying nor as complex as the brilliant first novel.",,

This trilogy truly ranks with the great achievements of the genre--the best of Doyle, Hammett, Chandler, and Macdonald.

I approached these three books cautiously 3 years ago, put off by the bestsellerdom and the hype that surrounded the books. Once I began (with the Girl with the Dragon Tatoo) I was hooked.

MM,"Reviewed in the United States on December 28, 2010",5 people found this helpful,3.0 out of 5 stars,Sophomoric slump,"""The Girl Who Played With Fire"" is one of those infuriating books which are not quite bad enough to abandon.To be clear, crime fiction is not a genre I typically read, and I started ""Tattoo"" solely for some mindless diversion while on a family vacation.  Like other readers, I was intrigued by the Lisbeth Salander character, even if other aspects of Stieg Larsson's first novel seemed less interesting.  However, in the second book of his trilogy, the author demonstrates that his inspired choice of heroine was pretty much the only good idea he had - and then he manages to squander that one.""Fire"" makes it abundantly clear that despite all the love the Larsson trilogy is receiving on bestseller lists, the whole series is simply a Nordic-inflected blast of cheesy pop fiction.  However, rather than throw it aside and move on to more rewarding material, I continued to read the lengthy second novel, albeit with increasing dissatisfaction and annoyance - hardly a ringing endorsement, but there it is.Among my complaints:- In the first novel, Salander was an undersized, dysfunctional loser with a random handful of capabilities that made her an improbable heroine.  She was interesting.  In ""Fire"", she's a cartoon superhero who suddenly sports a resume to make Lara Croft envious: she's a math savant on a Harley, a ninja-quick street fighter who dispatches bad guys with aplomb, and a misunderstood outcast shouldering a ludicrously dysfunctional family history.- Larsson's inexplicable insistence on specifying computers, cell phones, PDAs (really, PDAs?), and seemingly the entire IKEA catalog by model names inevitably makes his writing sound amateurish and outdated.- Too many bit-part actors!  Some of this may be due to my lack of familiarity with Scandinavian surnames, but the confusing stream of cops, journalists, and thugs did little to advance the already-muddled plot.The most damning indictment of all?  Despite my kvetching and disappointment in how thoroughly Larsson brought his promising debut novel crashing back to earth in ""Fire"", I bought the third and final book of the series.  Hope springs eternal.",,
Steven Peterson,"Reviewed in the United States on June 11, 2010",2 people found this helpful,5.0 out of 5 stars,"A riveting sequel to ""The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo""","This is a worthy successor to Stieg Larsson's first novel in the Millennium Trilogy. Larsson, in fact, projected ten volumes in the series, but--regrettably--died after the first three novels were completed. The positive note here is that the third volume serves to bring closure to many issues raised in the first two, so readers are not left hanging, although some story lines cry out for development (e.g., whatever happened to Lisbeth Salander's twin sister?).In the first volume, we saw the developing relationship between investigative reporter Mikael Blomkvist and Lisbeth Salander, computer hacker extraordinaire, possessed of a photographic memory, and absolutely brilliant in many ways. For instance, note her chess play with her former supervisor, Holger Palmgren. As the text notes (Pages 160-161): ""Salander sat there reading a book on the frequency calibration of radio telescopes in a weightless state. . .When Palmgren made his move she glanced up and moved her piece, apparently without studying the board, and went back to her back."" This (as well as the other two books) has various characters label her as being dysfunctional, whether exhibiting Asperger's or some other condition. Not likely, given her special abilities. Indeed, the book has it that she actually solves Fermat's theorem cleanly (a mathematical puzzle that took centuries for a faux solution).We begin, I think, to understand her social problems right at the outset. She is bound in an institution for the mentally ill after she had taken action as part of the ""All the Evil,"" in which she tossed a Molotov cocktail into a car being driven by the person who had brutally hurt her mother. The wretched monster? Let's call him Zala for now. . . . Instead of society treating her as a victim of viciousness (her mother had been brutalized by Zala over time), she is warehoused as a way of maintaining state secrets (Zala is protected by an office within Sweden's national intelligence apparatus).After the introduction alluded to above, we see Salander traveling the world, after having robbed a crooked billionaire of a portion of his fortune, thus making herself financially independent. She also distanced herself from Blomkvist, who had been her lover in the first novel, after he resumed his faithless ways (I see him as a bounder, to be honest--indeed, so does his sister, in her comments to Salander in the third book of the series). Blomkvist and his colleagues at Millennium magazine are working with Mia Johansson (a doctoral candidate) and Dag Svensson a freelance writer, readying a story on sex trafficking, the importation of women to serve as prostitutes in Sweden. This book, indeed the entire series, has a central focus on sexual politics, in sometimes the most tawdry terms. It is most explicit in this volume. It is also a work about government wrongdoing.A triple murder occurs--with Johannson and Svensson killed as well as Salander's ""overseer,"" maintaining contact with her because of her labeling as ""incompetent,"" Nils Bjurman. Salander's fingerprints are on the weapon used to kill all three, so she becomes the fugitive in a massive hunt for her. The story then hinges on a virtual partnership (by computer)  between Blomkvist and Salander. She refuses to see him after what she sees as his betrayal of her--although she also notes that he had behaved decently toward her. But she is willing to help him in his investigation of the murders of Johansson-Svensson and in his effort to vindicate her.There are some amazing scenes here, including the one where she takes on two powerful bikers and leaves them whimpering (you have to read this!). As Palmgren said at one point, if you point a gun at Salander, she'll find a bigger gun.There is a touching moment as she heads off to confront Zala (whose relationship with her adds an extra dimension of dramatic tension) and a giant blonde, the latter of whom is seemingly immune to pain. Before she begins her quest, Salander wants to tell Blomqvist via e-mail that she had been in love with him, but can't bear admitting. So, she simply says to him (Page 563): ""Thanks for being my friend.""Then, she moves to confront Zala (no spoiler here, but he is the one whom she threw the Molotov cocktail at when she was 12). Blomkvist, nervous at her last e-mail, thinking she was taking off to confront evil and even perish, tries to follow her. There is a horrific confrontation, with Salander miraculously escaping an extraordinarily perilous situation before getting a degree of revenge. But, she has been badly hurt, Blomqvist gets her airlifted for medical care, and we wait for the third book in the series, wondering what will come next.",VINE VOICE,Top Contributor: Baseball
William Capodanno,"Reviewed in the United States on July 5, 2010",One person found this helpful,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is one ""Fire"" You Want to Play With","I took some time between reading ""TGWTDT"" several years ago and ""The Girl Who Played with Fire"" which I just completed.  Larsson's second book in the trilogy does not disappoint and in my estimation even one-ups the first book.  Again, Lisbeth Salander and Mikael Blomquist are the central characters, althoug this time Salander becomes the hunted vs. the hunter.Larsson once again does a great job building the arc of the story over the first 100 or so pages rather than jumping in right from page one.  Lisbeth is traveling the world for 18 months on the hacked money and Blomquist and ""Millenium"" are working with a couple who are writing a novel and dissertation respectively on corruption and Eastern European prostitution ring in Sweden.  However, before it is published, both are murdered and Lisbeth winds up being a prime suspect for coincedental evidence found at the crime scene.It is amazing that Larsson can sustain the pace and plot twists over the course of nearly 600 pages.  In my mind, he crafts an even more engaging rollercoaster ride this go round.  Part of the reason is that Larsson begins to unravel the enigma and mystery that is Lisbeth by revealing the circumstances of her troubled youth.  While ""Dragon Tattoo"" gave us a glimpse into the master canvas he was painting, ""The Girl Who Played with Fire"" enabled us to see the master brush strokes and the vivid detail this great artist could achieve at the peak of his artistry.The only disappointment I had was that once I finished ""The Girl who Played with Fire"", I only had the the final novel in the trilogy to look forward to.  Having crafted two mesmerizingly entertaining books with the unlikeliest heroine, and knowing that he planned to write not 3 but 10 books in the series before his untimely death, one only wished that Larsson had lived to further entertain and surprise us.",VINE VOICE,
Jmaynard,"Reviewed in the United States on October 15, 2010",2 people found this helpful,3.0 out of 5 stars,Frustrating...,"A lot of my dissatisfaction with this book is because I thought the three books were independent mysteries.  Dragon Tattoo was a great story with a definitive conclusion.  However, this book is mainly a set-up for book 3 and has a massive cliffhanger ending.  The cliffhanger would not have been an automatic disappointment if the book had been a well-developed story, but it wasn't. This read like a bloated ""middle"" - half the book passes before the mystery is truly introduced, and again the author is excessive in giving unnecessary details.  Part of the problem is Lisbeth Salander.  In Tattoo, Blomkvist was the main character upon which the narrative focused and she was an intriguing, mystifying secondary character.  In Fire, she takes center stage and it doesn't work.  The first third of the book was following her around on a world trip seeing how she views the world.  But Tattoo already made it clear she's very different, I was quickly bored following her around with no focus.Once Blomkvist begins working with another journalist on a sex ring expose, and said journalist is murdered, the book did pick up. But, it went from boring to frustrating.  Lisbeth is the main suspect; a man-hunt for her is on.  Yet, the author spent too much time describing the clash of personalities within the police investigation, introducing new characters, and very little time actually advancing the mystery.  We go from following Lisbeth on her travels to having her every mundane action described (e.g. one full page tells readers she woke, made a pizza, took a shower, changed, straightened up, went back to bed, etc).  The ""conclusion"" quickly made it apparent that the mystery was never meant to be solved for this book.  The last few chapters were lightning fast, action-packed and revealed a lot of surprises and then slammed readers with the cliffhanger.  Two-thirds of this book could have been discarded (and I did skim a lot) and the rest added to the beginning of Hornet's Nest.Overall, though I disappointed, I'm still interested in the characters and the mystery.  However, this book left me feeling frustrated and not excited to move onto the last book.  I will read it, but I'm not in a rush.  Recommended to patient readers who liked the characters, and who have book 3 on hand and ready to start.",TOP 1000 REVIEWER,
Nancy O,"Reviewed in the United States on September 8, 2009",One person found this helpful,5.0 out of 5 stars,a solid sequel you won't want to put down,"This book is the second of three in Larsson's series featuring Lisbeth Salander, the young woman who has her own sense of morality and acts on it accordingly.  As this book opens, we find young Lisbeth in the Caribbean after the events of The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo.  Meanwhile, the erstwhile reporter Kalle Blomkvist and the team at Millennium are sitting on top of a goldmine of a story. With the help of a woman who is finishing her  PhD thesis and that of her husband, who is writing a book based on her findings,  Blomkvist is ready to publicly uncover a scandal in which some high-ranking officials are involved in sex trafficking from Russia and other parts of eastern Europe into Sweden.  Eventually Lisbeth returns home, and goes into hiding.  After a triple homicide, the police become interested in finding her (as does Blomkvist) because the clues at the murder scenes lead directly back to her.  At this point, Blomkvist, who is absolutely convinced that Lisbeth is innocent, begins his own investigation, working from a different starting point than that of the police.I love Lisbeth's character -- she refuses to be a victim even though her life is on the line.  She's a take-charge kind of person, apologizing to no one, and she is definitely an example of someone whose past has created her present.  She's a heroine unlike any other you'll find in crime writing -- very flawed, dark, unafraid, with a sense of morality that she acts on even if it goes against the social grain.  There are very few people in her life whom she trusts, and definitely has no love for official institutions. The book is fast paced, with never a dull moment, and is a solid sequel to Girl With the Dragon Tattoo.  I would definitely recommend that anyone thinking about this book start with Girl With the Dragon Tattoo, because there are a number of references in the 2nd book that you won't understand if you don't, and because once things start unraveling, you need to have the background of events from the first book, especially with the relationship between Lisbeth and Blomkvist.Girl Who Played With Fire leaves some things hanging, which I'm sure will be picked up in the upcoming third book (hopefully, since it's the last one).  I would recommend it to anyone who wants a good, solid mystery novel and who doesn't mind that the characters are all a bit flawed.  Not a cozy mystery at all, so if that's what you're looking for, skip it.  Otherwise, sit back and try to clear your day because you won't want to put this one down. Fans of Scandinavian crime novels will absolutely not be disappointed.",,
Ronald H. Clark,"Reviewed in the United States on June 7, 2010",One person found this helpful,5.0 out of 5 stars,Act II is even better than Act I,"This obviously is the second volume in the much praised trilogy by Stieg Larsson.  It is interesting because it just continues the story begun in the first volume. Believe me, it is absolutely necessary to have read the initial volume before tackling this 630-page thriller.  This book is both similar to but also different from its predecessor. Once again Larsson takes his time in setting the stage for what is to come; it is not until around page 220 that the story really begins to take off. That most fascinating creation of the author, Lisbeth Salander, once again is a key focus of the novel, and this time she is really the central character.  So we learn a great deal more about her than from the first volume.  Journalist Mikael Blomkvist also reappears, but he is definitely a secondary character to Salander, which is just the reverse of the first volume. I still have trouble keeping straight all these folks with similar Swedish names but that is my problem. The story line is once again very well developed, but this one is somewhat more complex than the first volume.Where the two books differ is that this one is much more the traditional murder mystery than its predecessor.  It also becomes a real ""page-turner"" of much more potency than the earlier book.  From about page 220 to the end at page 630, it is difficult to do anything else in your life but keep reading--it really moves and holds the reader. We have the more traditional story focusing upon a group of people trying to interpret various clues that pop up; there is a national dragnet in operation and its principal target proves too elusive for even crackerjack Swedish police experts to succeed in apprehension; and there is graphic and somewhat surprising violence, even more so than the earlier volume. Although I found the first 220 pages somewhat slower and less interesting than the beginning section of the first volume, the book as a whole is the better of the two in terms of suspense and emotion.I read with amazement many times that folks were so determined to find out what happened to the central characters in the third (and perhaps) final volume, that they were paying $200 to order copies from overseas before it was published here. Now I understand why; fortunately the third volume is now available in this country in hardcover and is not expensive.  The trilogy is a remarkable accomplishment by the late author. The story also translates very well to the screen, I note, having just seen ""The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo"" over the weekend. The film version of this volume is about to hit American screens as well.  In fact, the movie sort of let the cat out of the bag on several points that really only appear in this second volume, so don't be surprised if you see it. In the future, whenever I hear a book described as a ""thriller,"" I will know that I already have read an incomparable masterpiece of the genre.",,

Terry Mesnard,"Reviewed in the United States on October 20, 2009",One person found this helpful,5.0 out of 5 stars,Surprisingly better than the original,"How do you top a book that was excellently plotted, filled with memorable characters and an intriguing mystery?  Apparently, by changing up the formula, filling out the already great characters with even more character and spinning a mystery that's more devilish, more immediate and more character-driven than before.  In The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, Stieg Larsson created an excellent book that marked the beginning of a great author whose life was cut tragically short.  The Girl Who Played with Fire cements his status as a premiere thriller writer.  For those who haven't read the first book, beware because this review will obviously discuss the first book.At the end of Tattoo, our two characters Blomkvist and Salander have had a falling out and haven't spoken to each other.  Meanwhile, Bjurman, the evil sadist who was a minor yet insidious character in Tattoo, is still fuming over Salander's way of getting back at him by branding him as the sadist he is and holding onto a tape documenting his evilness.  The Girl Who Played with Fire starts out with a few different story strands like Tattoo.  Also, like Tattoo these apparently divergent stories end up colliding in shocking ways.  You have Salander's mysterious story, Bjurman's attempt to get rid of Salander on one hand.  On the other, there's the Millennium paper side of things that is going to publish a book on sex trafficing that will expose a variety of members in Swedish culture as being a part of it.  The stories converge in a shocking sequence of violence that propels the rest of the story forward.Unlike Tattoo, The Girl Who Played with Fire's story is much more immediate and character driven.  It delves more into Salander's character and answers many questions fans will have had when they finished the first book.  It's also much better paced and written.  One of the complaints I had about the first novel was that a lot of paragraphs had poor transitions into each other, making some sections feel more like vignettes than an interconnected story.  Fire plays out much better and the transitions were much smoother.  One area that tended to break my connection to the story were sometimes stupid characters.  At times, characters do thinks that seem to be more for the sake of moving the plot forward than for anything realistic.  Sometimes obvious clues are missed and other times the characters (particularly the police) seem completely ill suited for their jobs.  That said, character development for Salander is front and center, this time, and her story is one with quite a few little twists and turns.  Unlike Tattoo, where I figured out the central mystery pretty quickly into it, Fire surprised me multiple times in the direction it took.  My recommendation is to know as little about the story as possible and just let it take you along its tumultuous journey.I was really surprised with The Girl Who Played with Fire.  It upped the ante in terms of storytelling and pacing and presented some shocking situations that really sold me on Larsson's ability as an author.  I also really enjoyed Larsson's framing of the story as an algebraic equation.  Much like his use of statistics for the previous novel, Larsson uses an algebraic equation to introduce the sections and while it's not as obvious a connection as the stats, it becomes an ingenious framing device that sells the ending.  Like Tattoo, The Girl Who Played with Fire deals, once again, with Men Who Hate Women (as the Swedish original title indicates), but it tackles it in a larger purview.  An excellent read and a startling critique on Swedish society, it is a powerful thriller and one I'd recommend without a single reservation.",VINE VOICE,

Despite all the tongue twisting Swedish names for persons and places, Larsson's characters are brilliantly defined and real. Beyond that, the author has either put time into understanding psychodynamics and/or he's had professional inputs with re: his characterizations and his vivid portrayals of various of his characters pathologies as well as strengths. Lizbeth Salander is a most fascinating study. Though it is marginally suggested, both in The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo and The Girl Who Kicked The Hornet's Nest that Lizbeth might manifest Asperger's Syndrome, she indeed does manifest that disorder in my opinion. Yet, as in real life, it is tunnel-visioned to pidgeon hole and to perceive individuals as with solely one constellation of traits. And while it is ""easier"" to see someone in one way, as sociopathic by way of example, that person my truly be empathetic and available and caring in certain various circumstances. Larsson certainly portrayed such depth of understanding in developing his characters. He was also a wonderful story teller.

Detail is thrown in (guns by manufacturer's name, type, and caliber) which has nothing to do with the plot and then the author gets the details wrong (a Colt 1911 Government generally is .45-cal., not 9mm - there is a 9mm version, but it came out around two years ago and only in Australia). Everybody gets up, reviews their email, eats a pre-made pizza, smokes a cigarette, looks out the window, and engages in exposition before staying up until four in the morning, whereupon they go buy coffee, more pizza, and grab two hours of sleep. All right, I'm exaggerating. The story provides drama by the characters, particularly Salander, not sharing information with one another (not helped by a police team that does not look for a murdered journalist's laptop - really? - until late in the proceedings). We get inside peoples' heads but they apparently do not think about critical pieces of information while we are eavesdropping. Ever. Not until the end when suspense has been replaced by boredom. The good part: Salander is a little older and improving her camouflage. We get more of her history (it's as bad as you might imagine). But the contradictions in her personality are still not resolved (she cannot control herself, she engages in super-human self control, for example) and she ends up being a character who is more irritating than interesting.",,

Took me three or four times till I could deal with the Swedish names and locations.But once I read 50 pages, I was hooked.  Salander is a fantastic character.  Strange and wonderful - you wonder if they could make this into a movie and not screw it up.The Swedishness of the locations and characters is both a blessing and a curse - it's not commercial fiction in the sense of anything I've read before (and I read a LOT of it).  But it's an incredibly fast paced, lucid, arresting thriller.  Sometimes I found it hard to follow - but I couldn't put it down.Anyway.I JUST got the sequel and plunged into it without any of the ""getting into it"" problems of the first book.  Like a lot of Knopf publications, it's serious even though it's commercial.  It's a great book with fascinating characters and quite unlike the stuff you pick up at airports.I don't believe in giving away any of the plot - if you like Michael Connelly or Daniel Silva or Scott Turow or even John Grisham, you'll like this...though I think it asks more of you, more concentration, more commitment.I would read them in sequence - but you'll be done in a week.

I found it mesmerizing and a wonderful psychological thriller. The Millenium Magazine, where reporter Mikael Blomkvist works as a journalist, has two other journalists doing an expose on the sex-trade in Sweden. When they are killed, Lisbeth's fingerprints are found on the gun and she is hunted country-wide. Mikael does his own investigation and doesn't believe that she is responsible for the murders. However, a huge manhunt ensues for Lisbeth.Lisbeth's past life comes more into the forefront in this book and the reader gets to know what 'all the evil' means. We learn about her past and her family. Meanwhile, Lisbeth has managed, with her computer savvy, to steal several million kroner that once belonged to the criminal Wennerstrom and is living in a beautiful apartment that no one knows about. It is her safety net. Anyone who has been friends with Lisbeth is not safe, and this includes her old friend Mimi.Lisbeth is still strangely introverted, independent, and keeps away from Blomkvist. She befriends her beloved past guardian, the one before the evil Bjurson, and they play chess in his nursing home weekly. She even pays for a personal trainer to help him recover from his stroke.Gradually the reader finds out that there has been a huge conspiracy against Lisbeth since 'the evil began' and the action ups in ante. There are multi-national gangs involved, all dealing with sex and drug trafficking. These are not people to mess with but Lisbeth takes them on. Occasionally I got confused with the names of all the gang members and sex traders but I just kept on reading and it fell into place.I highly recommend this book and look forward to reading the next one in the trilogy.",TOP 500 REVIEWER VINE VOICE,

Best to read the first as it makes the 'Fire' more meaningful and like you're visitng old friends.  This felt like an epic and not just a typical thriller.  In both books I felt that the building of the story was masterful.  The development of characters was the best I've read for a long time, and the surprises more than once, had me laughing with excitement and surprise and complete awe of Stieg's intrinsic and yet simple way of leading you into the lives and feelings of his characters.  I loved Salander and Blomkvist, both are multi faceted and believeable whether you agree with life styles are not.I haven't enjoyed a week of non stop reading as much as this for years and years.  I only wish that the third was available right now! and that Stieg Larsson was still around to give us even more.  I would love to know if any of his other books are being translated.I can't say enough good about his writing.  It's not the typical thiller, murder mystery, or political thriller.  It is in a world of its own and I'm glad I got to enter that world.

And yet, really, you get the feeling that the bad guys are made to be so ultra creepy that it gives our little Lisbeth license to go out and beat the hell out of them with tasers and guns and knives and other devices.  And I have to admit that every time she took the bad guys on, I got those great goose bump and little tears in the eyes moments that make this such a fun read.  I don't want to give much more of the story away, but I found the book to be a much lighter and faster read than the first book.  I'll bet he wrote it in less than 1/2 the time as Tattoo.So, five stars is pushing it.  But when a character is created that you'll love the rest of your life and certain scenes are burned into your psyche forever, you can easily justify five stars.  This book is an R rated plus book.

ghost of a red rose,"Reviewed in the United States on January 1, 2011",2 people found this helpful,4.0 out of 5 stars,We Finally Get To Learn Lisbeth's Backstory,"I felt pretty much the same about this book as I did about The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo, although there were some things I liked better about this one, and some things I liked less.Like The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo, it is an usually intellectual book for the mystery genr√©, and highly original.  There was less about complex business wheelings and dealings, which I liked.  Again, there was also some advanced computer technology, much of which went over my head.  But I'm not complaining, I like to be challenged by a book.As for what I liked less about this one: I missed the complex family relationships and interactions - with occasional moments of affection - that were so important to the central mystery in The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo.  There is also much about family in The Girl Who Played With Fire, but in this case the family is so dysfunctional and estranged from one another that they are virtually strangers.  There is nothing complicated about their relationships, they just hate each other unequivocally.What I liked better was finding out so much about Lisbeth's backstory.  I was frustrated to know so little about her in The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo, but here Lisbeth's background is the whole story, and it comprises the central mystery in the novel.  I really enjoyed finding out about the family Lisbeth came from and how she came to be declared mentally ill and incompetent to take care of herself even as an adult.There were a couple of things that frustrated me in The Girl Who Played With Fire, but I expect that they may be cleared up in the third book of the series.  One was that we learn nothing about Lisbeth's twin sister.  The other was that the opening scene - and even Lisbeth's presence in the Caribbean - appears to have nothing to do with the rest of the book.As in the previous novel, there is a great deal of violence.  Lisbeth suffers so much damage in this one that I wonder how she can continue for a third book.I'm looking forward to reading The Girl Who Kicked the Hornet's Nest.",,

Melvin Anderson,"Reviewed in the United States on March 1, 2011",2 people found this helpful,5.0 out of 5 stars,salander comes to life,"This is volume two of a trilogy and it exceeds its predecessor in suspense and in relevance of the title to the contents it encompasses. It applies literally to Lisbeth Salander and the fire is the Molotove cocktail she uses on her father. It does not kill him so she can play further in her imagination with repeated applications of fire to him. The suspense occurs with the dropping of Lisbeth from the followed character in the writing but she is a suspect in three murders and the search for her and the reasons therefore are the subject of interest, the major character during this hiatus is Mikael Blomkvist who was the major character in ""The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo"".During all this time interest is retained in Salander'a whereabouts, we left her as she introduced herself to two of the murdered people and the book is written as though she must have been there when they were murdered, therefore she committed the murders. She finally contacts Mikael and claims not to have done the murders.The announcement soothes our feelings but we knew she did not do it anyhow; after all, she is the main character of the trilogy. or is supposed to be. Now the action speeds up again and on page 394 0f my volume we find out the significance of the prologue. The charges against Salander start to slip and the police officials begin to think there is substance to Blomkvist's theory of Salander's innocence. There are a plethora of characters brought in, some are journalists, some police, some private security, some criminals but all have a part to play to determine the final outcome. It is troublesome keeping the names and occupations straight but not nearly so bothersome as Larsson telling us every street or highway one of the characters is on or turns onto, does he think I am going to buy a map of Southern Sweden and follow all these turns? Even worse, the translator, who. I think, does a good job ruins his effort by tacking on -gatan or -agatan to the name of the street, I assume this is Swedish for street, road, avenue, parkway, etc., and is totally unnecessary, what does it do for the story? But it does distract me, it is used so much. Still I found the book to be more interesting than the Dragon Tattoo one and I highly recommend it.",,

Cai Yixin Jeremy,"Reviewed in the United States on November 17, 2010",One person found this helpful,5.0 out of 5 stars,The Girl Who Played With Fire by Stieg Larsson,"The Girl who played with Fire suffered from the same blunt prose that plagued the series starter, The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo. It still dragged along at inconvenient moments when one wished the plot picked up speed, but went on instead with mind-numbing expositions about what, series heroine, Lisbeth Salander, did during her modest holiday of sorts around the world. As we recalled from the previous book, Lisbeth did get some coin onto her breadbasket after a shrewd siphoning of Hans-Erik Wennerstrom's corrupt funds, but it seemed it was just the beginning.Nothing that Stieg has produced from his pen can be termed as simple.Just the pure fact these books were posthumous publications, were translations from the Swedish language, adds to the intrigue of the plot surrounding wholly disparate characters that seemed to be caricatures of real figures from Stieg's own life as an active journalist. He knew these people and wrote them into existence. If there were any questions to the characters ` reality, the quality of the character development, even with the peripheral ones, pushed them away with a silk-gloved hand. And Lisbeth stands as the exception, the only one that could be convincingly categorized as a character with almost no real-life counterparts. But even she has appealing elements in her that suggested Stieg's over-discussed intolerance to subservient violence.Which is to point out overtly to how Stieg recognized the human condition on such a deep level, that he produced such a plot device as an ambiguity factor to get Lisbeth into a bad light based on her contentious trimmings and her dysfunctions. A na√Øve perspective underlies much of the narrative, bordering on obsessive. Engineered to put as much emphasis on detail as possible seemed to be Stieg's approach, a perhaps antiquated discipline of writing that harkens back to Tolstoy or Dickens, when existential and trivial minutiae were in free flow. Achieving that with the direct language Stieg employed, even remarkable, and everything seemed to have a specific thematic or plot-related purpose that the winding prose doesn't indicate at first glance.As a continuation of the story or not, the overall arc has a grand scale (viewed as a standalone and as an entry of a series, both), winding down a literary road trodden a dozen times over but still leading somewhere never before seen, a terrifying peep into how Stieg's world view, his cynical and hardened perspective of how Crime functions in all its forms and layers. Lisbeth and the other characters were just forces driving that vision.Moreover, he pushed up his game by improving on the technical aspects of the writing and the prose, as if he saw fit to improve upon what already worked for him. He never lost it, going into this second book, even with the series' intrinsic flaws taken into full consideration. It was as if he couldn't help it.",,

This latest allows the reader to get to know the mysterious Lisbeth Salander (from Dragon Tattoo) even better by revealing more of her past that shapes her unique character.  Larsson is a master at creating complex plots, developing characters and making the reader shift gears and perceptions, willingly.  Both books were almost impossible to put down, and seem to soar to top priority on the 'to do' list.  Absolutely riveting!  I understand that the third book (Hornet's Nest) in this Millenium series won't be out until next year... I'm already drumming my fingers in anticipation to see what we learn about Lisbeth next.

Jack Garvey,"Reviewed in the United States on November 12, 2010",3 people found this helpful,3.0 out of 5 stars,Playing with Fire,"Having never read the first book in the trilogy, I got hooked by watching the Swedish film, ""The Girl with the Dragon Tatoo."" One movie reviewer commented that he felt the film ""tightened up"" the plot and elminated some unneccesary commentary.  It wasn't until I read ""The Girl Who Played with Fire"" that I understood the comment.In summary, this book would have been much more enjoyable as a 500 page novel instead of 700 pages.  It is often worth reading a novel of this size as the author has more time to develop the world he is leading you into.  But in my opinion, the author spent too many pages reviewing the events of the plot.  Like the first couple minutes of a TV series, the author wanted to tell me what I missed in the last episode. It was totally unnecessary and actually interfered with pace of the plot.So, with the negatives out of the way, let me share what I enjoyed most.  It was the writer's ability to weave an interesting and complex story.  This talent became especially apparent after I watched the film version of the 2nd book.  The movie choose to tell the story in logical sequence and lost most of what was interesting in the novel.  What I liked most about the book was the dance between the interior and exterior reality of the characters.  In that it reminded me of one of my favorite novels, ""Sometimes a Great Notion"" by Ken Kesey.  It was that weaving of the character's emotions with the events of the plot that made the book an interesting read.  It is unfortunate that the writer won't be around to refine his craft in coming novels.",,

I hope that his family is able to develop a fund that will continue his work and addressthe issues of sex slaves and the abuse of women in Sweden. (Not that Sweden is alone in these crimes) I am sorry that the author died so young and hasn't gotten to enjoy the fruits of his writing.and I am ready to order the third in June 2011!,,

Evil is everywhere, leavened only by the answering kindness and willingness to get involved of some people.  It's probably a pretty fair assessment of reality.  This book is just as dark as volume 1 (Girl w the Dragon Tatoo), so I recommend that you plan on also reading the 3rd volume (Girl Who Kicked the Hornets' Nest) which ravels it all up again, and sheds some sunlight (and hope) into the story.  Because, in the end, it is one story and one book.The books are long, but gripping.  The characters are very believable - you come to feel of them as friends (when they allow it) and you root for them.  The writing is nearly faultless - surprising, given their author's inexperience at this genre - and the translations are superb.  I'm looking forward to the Swedish movies made from these books.",,

Critic's Corner,"Reviewed in the United States on February 5, 2011",One person found this helpful,5.0 out of 5 stars,Better Than Expected; Some Flaws!,"Playing with fire:In this brief review I try not to get too involved in plot details and summary, leaving it up to the reader to find them out him/herself.  Let's just say that the men who hate women also hate Salander and they really pay for their indiscretions in this book.  There are still some loose ends but I'm hoping Larsson ties them up in the third book.The second Larsson book is just as brilliant as the first one, even more so for several reasons.  In the first book we met a quirky but bright girl named Salander.  Then we meet a journalist bulldog named Blomkvist.In the second book the author ties up loose ends from the first book, creates more loose ends which (hopefully) will be tied up in the third.  In the middle we have some intense actions and interesting detective work.Larsson really loves criticizing authority in this novel.  The police detectives, themselves competent, have to deal with leaks and criminal mischief in their own ranks.  The two who leak info to the press have their own grudges against Salander.The build-up of suspense is quite slow:  We learn of Salander's adventures in the Caribbean, her return to Sweden to look up some old friends, checks up on the rapist pig that is Bjurman, who himself is trying to hire a hit-man to rub out Salandar (thanks to a damning video explained in the first book) and suddenly finds herself an interested party in a triple murder!Larsson's themes of corrupt journalism, lack of privacy of the individual citizen, the rampant disregard for patients from the psychiatric profession is real, is fascinating and is clearly taken from Larrson's own experiences.The ending of the novel wraps some things up, but Blomkvist still needs to put up with some pretty blatant stupidity on the part of the police force (there's a sneak peek at the end of the book for ""Kicked the Hornet's Nest."").Salander is kicked, punched, shot at and left for dead and yet still manages to be a prime character in this exciting, at times plodding, yet fascinating thriller of a book.A must-read!Other Larsson Books!Stieg Larsson's Millennium Trilogy Deluxe Boxed Set: The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, The Girl Who Played with Fire, The Girl Who Kicked the Hornet's Nest, Plus On Stieg LarssonVergebungThe Man Who Left Too Soon: The Biography of Stieg Larsson",,

27Quincy,"Reviewed in the United States on June 27, 2010",,5.0 out of 5 stars,You'll burn through the pages,"I remember very much wanting to read this book, the second in a trilogy, right after I finished the first one, but one thing led to another (I've got young kids!) and three months slipped by.  If you're at all wondering, you should definitely read the first book in the series (The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo) first; you'll want to read it anyway if you read this one, and it really does set the stage.  What I liked about this book was pretty much what I liked about the first book: its quirkiness and unexpected twists.  The author includes lots of little details that aren't at all necessary to the plot, but are just kind of interesting.  For instance, the head doctor at an old folks' home in Sweden is from Sri Lanka.  These little details just give the book a lot of texture and depth that an ordinary thriller would lack.  To be honest, the book dragged for me a bit in the middle, when it got into the details of a police investigation, but the beginning and the end are gripping.  If you're like me, one of the best feelings is feeling like you can't put a book down, and sure enough I stayed up til 2 AM last night before I finally conked out (made it through a few critical chapters).  Finished the book today, and enjoyed it, although probably a shade less than the first one.  I was kind of annoyed that the back cover of the paperback gives away important plot elements that didn't happen until about a third of the way through the book - kind of the way that movie previews nowadays give away way too much.  For me, a lot of the pleasure in this series is sitting back and letting the book take me on a wild ride with no idea where I'm headed.  For that reason, if you're reading reviews before buying the book, you really ought to stop right now because you're denying yourself the pleasure of unexpected discoveries, unless you happen to move in Swedish lesbian satanic cult circles.",,

This second book of the series has more twists and turns than alpine roads.  It draws you in to the tumultuous life of Lisbeth Salander and makes you feel every injustice she has endured.  At the same time and even as you are made privy to the deliberate actions she takes against those to seek to destroy her (many of them quite illegal), you are in her corner rooting for her to do even more.  The end of the book was so brutal that I was almost physically ill and yet I couldn't purchase the third offering and devoured it, delighting in every punch that was directed at her adversaries.The descriptions of the legal procedures and political parties of Sweden became a bit boring as I wanted more action from Lisbeth but it was there too.",,
Joseph Palen,"Reviewed in the United States on May 23, 2010",,5.0 out of 5 stars,The Small Girl With a Huge Spirit,"If Larsson had not passed away, he would now be on my list of favorite writers. After these first two books in his thriller trilogy, I have become really fond of the 95 pound, 4ft 11, weird genius,super hacker girl with the unbeatable spirit, and am really glad there is a third book. Like the first book this one has long slow sections with excruciating detail that you are tempted to think the editor left in only out of respect for the dead  BUT the exciting parts made it worth while for me. Actually, the fact that everytime my eyes began glazing over they were suddenly forced wide open, probably enhanced the effect of these interspersed exciting passages. The big thing here for me, however, was the further character development of the spunky little heroine, who now is shown to also have a heart - maybe. This is the book in which ""All the Evil"" is finally exlained. We almost lost our little heroine near the end, and it is still touch and go on the last page. On the book 3.I almost forgot, our heroine also solved Fermi's famous math problem in her head on the way to confront her father and brother in a fight to the death - but we were not told her solution - on to Book 3!",,

The story is little involved but it is credible. The only reason for giving 4 stars is that the middle section (where it goes on at length with the personality description of the various characters) is a little too long. At that point, I was ready to know what had happened to the main character, I was not so interested in the details of some obscure policemen.

The first story was so different and so addicting I found myself reading a book I didn't want to end. That hasn't happened to me in years and years, and I read 6-8 books per week. When I finally put it down I raced to Amazon.com to see what else he had written and found therre were two more books in this series, neither of which were released yet. And I also found out, much to my chagrin and saddness that the author was deceased! Nooooooooo!!! I immediately ordered the next book, ""The Girl who Played with Fire"" and then waited the agonizing weeks for it to become available. Meanwhile, I recommended the first book to all my friends. When the second book finally came I read it all in one sitting. Such intersting characters, plots and plenty of suspense!

Neena,"Reviewed in the United States on January 22, 2011",,5.0 out of 5 stars,One of those books that draws you into a world you're sad to leave,"I've noticed that folks that shy away from this trilogy are nervous about the sexual violence.  I think perhaps the premise of ""The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo"" is at fault: Lisbeth Salander, a victim of sexual violence herself, helps journalist Mikael Blomkvist uncover the crimes of a sexual predator and serial killer.  If you're afraid of the grit but wonder why everyone is so in love with the trilogy, I think you could skip straight to ""The Girl Who Played with Fire.""  ""The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo"" is more or less a self-contained episode, and the last two books of the trilogy are a super fascinating spy and espionage story.""The Girl Who Played with Fire"" picks up where ""The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo"" left off, but the adventures of Lisbeth Salander take a new turn as her personal past is revealed.  Her biography and the history of a illegal secret faction of the police are intricately woven.  The world Larsson creates is full of incredibly intelligent or incredibly evil characters.  It is a hyper-reality.  When I finished the first book, I couldn't wait to dive into the next.  There were so many equally important cliff-hangers that I was completely hooked.And I think that is the charm of the book in general.  Larsson's writing style is a tapestry, seriously.  He juggles several sub-plots at the same time.  Sometimes they intersect, sometimes they  cover two perspectives on the same slice of time.  The craftsmanship with which he unfolds the story is exactly what makes it so addictive.  There is always an open thread, and I found myself always turning the page looking forward to where that thread would lead.Also, I think that uneasy folks would be happy to know that Larsson is a feminist.  On the one hand it seems like falling on crimes like rape, etc. is kind of hitting below the belt.  It's too easy.  Larsson wants to create a super evil character, so he falls back on rape or porn or something to the effect.  Larsson doesn't really make his villains emotionally evil.  In other words, there is a lot of tragedy in his story, but there are no tears.  No sense of injustice that rips your heart out.  The book doesn't tug at your heart-strings.  None of the characters are emotional; they are calculating, intelligent, or over-the-top bigamists.  On the other hand, his books have several very strong, intelligent male and female characters.  There is a balance.  Mikael and Lisbeth are the two super heros; male and female.  There are male and female heroes at Milton security, male and female heroes in the police, male and female at Millennium.  So in that sense, though he falls back on crimes against women, women are fighting those crimes.",,

Can you think of a female character who is anything like Jack Reacher or Lucas Davenport, and remains female?Not many authors can bring a character like Lisbeth Salander into being.  Lisbeth is the ultimate survivor, independent to a fault, and utterly ruthless when it comes to protecting herself and her friends. She's also endlessly inventive, and so full of anger that she could power all of Scandinavia on her very own.Take a young woman like Salander, put her in a threatening situation, and watch her go to work. In this novel -- which was more revealing, but less cohesive than the first -- many mysteries about Lisbeth's past are revealed, but each of them only underscores how very different she is and makes you more curious. I wouldn't wish Salander's personal history on anybody, but I hope that women like her exist in the world. She stands in the middle of her own powerful story and won't be overshadowed.",,

There is far too much minute detail and sidetracks that are frustrating diversions from the main story. Sometimes it seems as if I am reading a screenplay with demanding emphasis on the setting rather than the story. It is almost as if the author is bragging about how much research he did into the sex trade industry, or the organization of certain Swedish government agencies. I realize that this English trilogy  is a translation from Swedish, and I have no idea how much style is lost in translation. I kept feeling that the book was a collection of chapters printed in monthly magazines over a period of time. The fact that all three books were submitted right before the writer's demise suggests that it might have been his family who decided to publish works they found among his possessions.

The mystery, as with the first book, is smart and creative and keeps you guessing till the end.

Sandra Ramos O'Briant,"Reviewed in the United States on March 28, 2010",One person found this helpful,4.0 out of 5 stars,Punk Meets Pedophile,"In Larsson's first book, The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo, we're introduced to one kickass heroine in the form of the petite and punked-out Lisbeth Salander. She returns in the second book sans one tattoo and her nose ring, but with breast implants.Larsson underlined her boyish appearance in the first book, and the sadistic pedophiles she attracted because of it, so the new boobs are a dramatic departure. On the other hand, they may just be another couple of piercings for her. We are meant to see a softer side of Salander, but don't let her new toys fool you. Once she takes them for a test run with a new guy and an old girlfriend, she's still the same feisty-cum-deadly adversary we've grown to love.Her bisexuality fits right in with the popular freewheeling stereotype of Sweden, but homophobic cops do not, nor do the unequal treatment, sexual harassment, and brutalization of women, especially the psychiatric professionals who have ""a state-endorsed mandate to tie down disobedient little girls with leather straps.""In addition, while Blomkvist, the other central character in both books, is fine with his primary lover, Erica Berger, being married, and she admits to enjoying the occasional m√©nage, even he would never consider a three-way with she and her husband. That just doesn't seem Swedish, if you know what I mean.In Larsson's first book, each chapter was introduced with a statistic of the abuse women suffer in Sweden at the hands of men. Indeed, the original title of that book was ""Men Who Hate Women."" In The Girl Who Played With Fire, big money criminals, petty thugs and a corrupt SAPO (Swedish National Police Board), collide with a thriving sex trade. If sex is so freely available in Sweden, how do prostitutes and their pimps thrive?Larsson gives us a birds-eye view of ordinary middle class people living conventional lives. The other lesson is that purchased sex comes with permission to be brutal, and therefore attracts a certain brand of customer. With the former, we indulge in one of the primary pleasures of foreign fiction - a glimpse at how other people live their lives, but with the latter we get the author's point-of-view through both Salander and Blomkvist.""What's right,"" is something both characters contemplate. Loyalty is at the top of the list for each of them, and Salander is learning about friendship. A major turn for Lisbeth is her growing ability to trust men. Frequent coincidence is an all too convenient authorial device to move the plot forward. Both the police and a private detective agency are a bunch of inept bunglers, but I ignored them because I wanted to find out what happened next.I was hoping that Salander would mete out her particular form of punishment to the bad guys with a full charge of her taser. I was not disappointed. Even without that charming bit of modern technology, Lisbeth is a quick thinker, lithe, and she fights with everything she's got. The girl has suffered plenty in her life, and it's payback time moderfokker!**contrived reviewer Swedish slang[...]",,

Nate Kowal,"Reviewed in the United States on February 17, 2011",,5.0 out of 5 stars,Not What I Expected,"After finishing the first book in The Millenium Trilogy I was worried about reading the second and third books because I thought nothing could top the neat little package that was The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo. Lucky for me and millions and millions of others, I was wrong.The book starts off simple and stays that way for a while but also not in the way that it was hard to get through the beginning of The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo for the first time. I was excited to read backstory - especially about Lisbeth - so much so that I was so caught up with it that when the main conflict struck I was completely caught off guard. The book is more relaxed that the first in the series and that was nice to see because when Larson is relaxed his writing and his characters are at their best. In the last half of the book, just like last time it became a race to see the resolution and I couldn't turn pages fast enough.I blew through the book in less than a week and was glad that I had the third book already on my Kindle so that I could start it right away. My best recommendation when it comes to this book other than reading it is having the third one on hand so that you can immediately start reading it after finishing this one. This is part 1 of a two part adventure and it is simple to figure out why - you don't want to carry around a thousand page volume for two weeks or more.",,

NightOwl,"Reviewed in the United States on August 12, 2012",,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Had to Self Edit as I Read, BUT....","It was still a strong story. However, simply put it was AT LEAST 250 pages too long--AT LEAST. The beginning of this book grips you as we watch Lisbeth Salander weather a tropical storm and save the life of another helpless woman.  I could call that part unnecessary and expositional but the entire part effectively endears us to Lisbeth Salander. She IS the allure of these books. Period. And so by the middle of the book, as soon as the journalists are murdered, we lose sight of her for pages and pages and PAGES! And I grew more and more and MORE frustrated by the endless tail-chasing by the police and the other journalists. And the repetitive dialog of the details. Because I knew the entire time that Mikael and Lisbeth were going to solve the murders anyway!!! Not the police! That's how these stories go. The antag and protag solves the case! So why in the world do what to read through all of that blabbering???? Then to make it worse we, the readers, learned early one who killed them all anyway! It was just exhausting, BUT...I don't know. I give it 4 stars instead of 3 because, even with the dense and repetitive quality of the prose, Larsson has created a masterpiece when he created Lisbeth Salander, and that is not easy to do. And, furthermore, I couldn't sleep. I had to keep reading through the tail-chasing until Lisbeth reappeared. Then, once she showed up, I couldn't get enough! Ended up going to bed at 5:30AM and finishing today! Now that's the reason why readers are always on the search for a good book. The, ""I can't put it down"" high. The fact that I had to speed read/self edit through the bulk of it, took it from a 5 to a 4 star.I would say, to those who are considering this series that it's totally worth getting to know Lisbeth Salander.But I don't know if I have the energy to get through the third book; I'm still assessing myself--I'll know soon.",,

This one gets off to an awkward start trying to bring the new reader up to speed with the events of the first book - it doesn't really work, and there are some things that just have to be read in the original to make any sense (Lisbeth's stolen fortune, her blackmail of Bjurman, her affair with Blomkvist, just to name a few). Consider yourself cautioned.3.

When three murders are discovered within the city and tied back to Salander, she goes underground.  While Blomkvist immerses himself in proving Lisbeth's innocence and finding the real killer of his friends, Lisbeth herself is less concerned with the media's portrayal of her as a murdering psychopath and much more focused on following the trail of blood to see where it leads.  Where it takes her is on a trip into her past....a painful past that brings her face-to-face with an age-old enemy whose very existence is impossible to prove....A huge improvement from its slower predecesser, The Girl Who Played With Fire is a thriller of the highest order.

The Swedes  have been trying to deal with this issue ever since the end of the Thirty Year's War in 1648, and then their complicity with the Nazis in WWII.  This little book addresses all of these issues very well, and the actress who plays the Girl With The Dragon Tattoo does a good job, and has a cute chest as well!.",,
Ray Eyler,"Reviewed in the United States on November 9, 2015",,5.0 out of 5 stars,The Trilogy Continues to Amaze,"The second book in the trilogy does not let up or let you down.  This is my second reading of the trilogy and I find it just as compelling as the first time I read them.  Stieg Larsson sense of Sweden makes you feel that you are right there all the time.  I have never been to Sweden, but now I am dying to go.",,
Nebbeygirl,"Reviewed in the United States on October 1, 2012",,2.0 out of 5 stars,not what I expected......,"I guess I did not realize that this book was listed as ""acceptable"" condition when I purchased it.  But to me, acceptable would be not written in, no torn pages, with slip cover on outside and hardcover in ok shape.  So let me say, the book that I received was written in, no slip cover on the outside, the hardcover stained and the corners bent and torn.  I will definitely be more careful when choosing my books from now on. This one even cost more than the other one in this trilogy I bought that was in better shape. It won't happen again.On the other hand, they did send the book out to me earlier than I thought I was going to get it.",,
Larjane,"Reviewed in the United States on March 17, 2013",One person found this helpful,5.0 out of 5 stars,He kicked the can on down the road.,This book sets up the story for the third book while fleshing out the story from the first book.  I liked everything about the book except the place names.  Too bad I am not from there or they would all make sense to me.  The stories do not suffer from my ignorance of other countries.  People who like to see a project to the end would love this second book.,,
Kathy Parsley,"Reviewed in the United States on October 25, 2012",,5.0 out of 5 stars,Superb second installment in the Stieg Larsson Millennium Trilogy,"What can I say that hasn't already been said about this book? The saga continues with Lisbeth Salander, as more is revealed about her life. She is once again paired with Mikael Blomkvist as they race against time to solve the murders of two journalists who were set to publish an expos√© on the sex trafficking trade. Filled with page-turning action and suspense, this book had me reading well into the night to finish.",,
D. Rothmeyer,"Reviewed in the United States on December 6, 2010",,5.0 out of 5 stars,MUCH better than the first book,"I wasn't impressed with the first book of this trilogy.  200 pages in and Lisbeth (the girl the books about) was barely a blurb.  Thank god it picked up or I might not have made it far enough to finish that one let alone 2nd.I sampled the this 2nd book on my kindle and my first through was that it was at least starting with active movement in the characters and 200 pages of dull backstory.  So I decide to commmit to the 2nd book...The Girl Who Played with Fire.I was not disappointed.  This book has constant movement that keeps you intrigued throughout.  It picks up a few months after the first but you don't feel you've left out anything. And hey, this one actually has the title character in it from beginning to end.I'm reading the 3rd and final one now.  It has started right where this book left off so it feels less like a new book and more like the story of this one continuing.If you can make it through the first one...this one is worth it.",,

I love listening to the audiobooks too because I dont know how to pronounce a lot of the words, so it makes it easier to follow along when i can hear someone pronounce the words correctly. Great story!!",,
