Rosy,"Reviewed in the United States on September 3, 2015",45 people found this helpful,1.0 out of 5 stars,"dull, stuffed with a deadly showing-off-my-research thread about a ...","Pompous, dull, stuffed with a deadly showing-off-my-research thread about a financial journalist's career and enthralling details of Swedish commerce.  You can tear off the first inch of the book and never miss it.  Every main character is a gorgeous sexual bombshell and an offhand genius--oh, and wealthy--and none of them mind sharing. Everyone loves them and you know they'll come out on top. The relationships are a combination of some lonely virgin guy's uninformed fantasies and alienated family members out of Henrik Ibsen or maybe Beckett, blazing with fifty-year-old hate.  The freakier characters are so out of date it's embarrassing--mad Nazi torturers in 2000? with underground abbatoirs (didn't the tax assessor notice?), perverted social workers abusing their power, aphasic sociopath/genius computer hacks who can't cry and live unwashed in rat warrens, yet can walk into Swiss banks and discuss investments or impersonate a gilded heiress without a bit of coaching.  Did I mention that, after building the tiny character of a friendly cat, the author kills and mutilates it as an important plot twist (so you can't avoid it)?  This is a few hours you'll never get back.",,
"Nick Nicholas, MSW","Reviewed in the United States on June 20, 2016",28 people found this helpful,4.0 out of 5 stars,Indelible Ink,"Although this book is the first of a trilogy (now a tetralogy thanks to an author working from the manuscripts Larsson left behind prior to his untimely death), it stands well on its own right. It is a dark and moody book, much like Sweden in which the book is set, and much like the character for whom the book is named. The text does not grab the reader immediately with graphic descriptions of horrific events. It begins almost pianimissimo and in a molto adagio style (with a few moments of high tension scattered through the book) rises towards a crescendo towards the end as the protagonist is captured by the villain and escape seemed impossible. These musical metaphors are quite apt because the book moves like a Mozartian symphony.The two central characters are well fleshed out. Even the bizarre appearance and behavior of Lisbeth Salander becomes nor only acceptable but also understandable. Mikael Blomkvist, the ostensible protagonist (or is the titular ""girl with the dragon tattoo"" the true protagonist of this novel?), receives a great deal of attention from the author, but his role is more expository rather than a study in character. Lisbeth Salander is very much a study in character, and even though she is missing from key scenes, even large swaths of the book, yet her brooding presence never disappears entirely.This truly was one of those rare books you never wanted to end, and even through The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo stands well on its own as a novel, I look forward to reading other books in the series.",,
AP,"Reviewed in the United States on July 16, 2019",5 people found this helpful,3.0 out of 5 stars,Mediocre,"The problem with the books is that they are more about Blomkvist than lisbeth salander. She always comes late in the novels. supposedly she is the main character and therefore she should be an active from the very beginning, which makes the book more about investigation that than action, which wouldn’t be bad if she was more involved.I also find that there is too many characters, in my opinion a lot of unnecessary characters, and their names are so complicated and very much alike That is difficult to follow up, I understand it is a Swedish book but Simplicity is very valuable. I wish both Lisbeth and Blomkvist worked more closely together as it is they barely communicate and is mostly from a few computer frases.As they are the books are very complicated, a little boring and so much is unnecessary.",,
Bill Dolworth,"Reviewed in the United States on August 9, 2019",3 people found this helpful,3.0 out of 5 stars,It's Okay But Overall Not Very Compelling,"The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo is mostly boring. The dialog is sometimes stilted.  It consists of too many speeches whose primary purpose is to advance the exposition. The lead characters, in the face of an imminent danger, do dumb things. Incredulously, the male lead gets more action than James Bond. Young, middle-aged, and married woman throw themselves at him. Even another male has the hots for him.The young female lead is a loner, who is mad at the world and has a general distrust of men. She is a psychologically damaged person and although it’s never delved into, she may have some form of autism. Her talents as a computer hacker and private investigator so immense that she does not seem like a person operating in real life. Her character would be more appropriate in a story set in a superhero universe.A large portion of the Larrson’s book is about the crooked dealings a Swedish financier. These passages come off as flat because he is never a fully developed as a character. He is more of a bogey man.The main story is about the investigation of the whereabouts of a girl from a wealthy family, who mysteriously disappeared in the 1960s. The plot meanders because it’s bogged down with way too many potential suspects who are mostly from her old-money family. The resolution of this story feels like it should be the ending of the book. However, there are multiple chapters that follow that seem more like an epilogue and are a chore to get through.",,
Teddie S,"Reviewed in the United States on September 21, 2015",13 people found this helpful,5.0 out of 5 stars,What a great read!,"The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo is an intriguing book title.  It's also an intriguing description of the female protagonist in this story. She is a 24 year old computer hacker with a photographic memory, a screwed up personal life, and a big chip on her shoulder. The male protagonist is a disgraced financial journalist who has been found guilty of libel, and whose business magazine he is part owner of is on the verge of shutting down. The two are hired by the elderly head of a wealthy family to find out what happened to his beloved niece who disappeared 40 years prior.I loved this book in spite of the graphic sadistic violence and the unfamiliar Swedish names and words sprinkled through the book.  The plot was suspenseful and kept me interested right to the end. I am definitely looking forward to reading the other two books in the series.",,
Rick Howard,"Reviewed in the United States on March 24, 2014",12 people found this helpful,4.0 out of 5 stars,Worthy for Consideration for the Cyber Security Canon,"See the full review at my blog site: Terebrate.You have heard of this book from watching one or both of the movies that have sprung from it, but do yourself a favor: take the time to read through this one. It is a fantastic story involving a complex mystery and engaging real-world characters. The overarching theme though is the spotlight that the author, Stieg Larsson, places on Swedish culture's egregious acceptance of violence against women. Lisbeth Salander is the tattooed girl referred to in the book's title. She is an orphan, a ward of the state, a hacker with a photographic memory who works for a private investigation firm, and a young woman who refuses to be a victim. She is an amazing character, a real woman with strengths and flaws but who can be held up to us all as an example to admire and to aspire to in regard to her drive, intelligence, and agency. It is written well, despite being translated into English from Swedish, and because the hacking described within is not exaggerated and could actually work, it is worthy of consideration for the cyber security canon. You should have read this by now.",,
KD,"Reviewed in the United States on October 21, 2017",2 people found this helpful,5.0 out of 5 stars,Really enjoyed this book!,"I have seen the movie a couple times, and since I enjoyed it I had decided to read the book to see how much more to the story there was. I always anticipate that a movie based on a book will be vastly different than the book, because that's usually the case. It wasn't, however (not this time).The movie follows the book pretty closely, if I recall the movie correctly. There's much more detail in the book though, which helps to understand the story and the context better.Even with the serious subject matter & starting the book already knowing the basic story from the movie, it was a very intriguing read. I think I'll move on to the next book now!",,
Sam Hill,"Reviewed in the United States on August 10, 2013",14 people found this helpful,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Wonderfully riveting, with only a few hiccups","As others have mentioned this book is slow off the mark; but eventually, maybe 30% of the way in (I'm reading the kindle edition so there are no page numbers),  we reach cruising speed at last.  Then it comes into its own as a really first-class thriller and the kind of book one doesn't want to put down.  My advice: it pays to persevere!At times, the language of the English translation is a bit too goose-steppingly wooden,  but one gets over that in short order.Some readers objected to the author's including a few menus for snacks enjoyed by the protagonists.  For my part, I found that of interest, and have adopted one of them for my own repertoire: marinated herring, sour cream or tadziki and chives, bread, beer.  Quick and nutritious. Thanks, Stieg!For truly boring, endless and perfectly irrelevant menu descriptions, one cannot beat the ones saddled  upon the reader in the appalling books #4 & 5 of the medieval saga _Game_of_Thrones_ by George R. R. Martin.  In comparison, Mr. Larsson is countless light years above that.Happy reading!",,

M. Carpenter,"Reviewed in the United States on January 2, 2013",9 people found this helpful,3.0 out of 5 stars,Public demand is the disappointment,"SPOILERS: This was a disappointing read. I have not chewed on it enough to identify completely why though. As I read it I thought it was probably the public demand for such writing that may be the cause of my disgruntled response. What is the public obsession with heavily saturated unrealistic and sometimes disgusting sexual context? The main character (at least on the cover) is a mid twenties young woman that looks fifteen. There are multiple, many unhealthy, sexual encounters involving her in this story. The author cleverly uses this character to draw interest in the book and to prey on what I assume is the mentality of middle aged men who are drawn to these types of women and exploits. This is not even the only issue with women in the story. There are several story lines that involve unhealthy sexual relationships and sexual crimes that are abhorrent. I am not religious or a social Puritan in any sense and have no issue with sex in these story lines at all. I do feel however, that this story uses that as bait to carry the story and it is unnecessary.This is not my only issue with this book. Too many concepts are borrowed in my mind to make this satisfactory. I loved the mystery and intrigue in searching for answers to the Vanger story, but the deeper it ran the more concepts seemed to sound familiar. The religious undertones and grotesque crimes were very reminiscent of Dan Brown's books both in Angels and Demons and the Da Vinci Code. That was fairly annoying. The rushed corporate ""wrap up"" at the end was almost laughable when Lisbeth masqueraded around to steal money at different banks a la Shawshank Redemption, which led to the almost invisible paper doll antagonist's death, also as in Shawshank.My issues with this book had nothing to do with the style or writing itself. It was an enjoyable read in flow and in maintaining your interest. My main issues revolved around the thirst we all seem to have for quite vile concepts. In reality a middle aged man with multiple sex partners, including one that apparently looks underage would be frowned upon. Here we are led to not only accept but approve of such an arrangement. We are almost endearing of their cute relationship in the end. This same character is violated by another older man in horrific ways, several others face similar fates from family members, and we all cheer on such imagery. I think this book would have been just as enjoyable if those premises had been changed a bit. I am sure I am in the minority, but in my case, it will not lead me to read the remaining books in this series.",,
Noni,"Reviewed in the United States on September 25, 2015",2 people found this helpful,5.0 out of 5 stars,You are in for a treat,"Oh what a treat for anyone who hasn't yet read this first rate book. The story starts with Mikael Blomkvist, a journalist, being convicted of publishing false information about a wealthy industrialist. He is unable to defend himself because of not wanting to reveal his source. Elsewhere in Stockholm is Lisbeth Salander, a most unusual young woman who works for a security company and is an adept computer hacker. We are also introduced to Henrik Vanger, an old man whose young niece disappeared many years ago, presumed murdered, and yet every year on his birthday he is reminded of her when a mysterious present arrives. These characters all come together to make a most exciting and unusual story.This is a great story with unusual but credible characters. The best bit is that there are so far another 3 equally good books which follow on from it. The only negative is the Swedish names which can be hard to get ones tongue around and hard to remember. Well worth the effort though.",,

Conitis,"Reviewed in the United States on December 9, 2019",,5.0 out of 5 stars,The best novel I've ever read,"Although the early part of book one of this trilogy is a very slow read, without it you'd be lost later in the story.  The books are real page turners.  I read a large portion on a noisy subway commuting to work.  The story was so engrossing that I easily tuned out the noise of my surroundings and fellow commuters.  A great story.  If you watch the movie the Swedish version with the English subtitles  is the better version.  The English language version is poorly edited and doesn't do the story justice.",,
Reinold F.,"Reviewed in the United States on June 30, 2018",5 people found this helpful,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Seems literature, but actually is a political statement that preaches intolerance and discrimination.","When Dante wrote the Divine Comedy there were characters that were in Hell despite having his sympathy and affection: a good writer knows when to leave their characters to breath and grow without the writer influencing the story. Is bothering in the Iliad when the gods interfere in the fights. The author doesn't let breathe the characters, he judges them according to their political choice and decide their dooms according those choices, even more, he kidnaps them to explain his politics through them, making them out of character.The book start in a powerful way... there is a crime and there are two persons that are going to be kind of detectives: Mikael and Lisbeth, trying to solve an apparent impossible case. Both are interesting and clever... and the pace is thrilling... but then the book ends in a kind of sad parody:* Without giving spoilers in the end the case is simply discarded... there is not a clever solution to the mystery of the case... wasted time for a pair of detectives without nothing to investigate.* The ""good ones"" are ALWAYS leftists and the ""bads"" are ALWAYS rightists. And the author awards the former and punishes the latter. Honestly it is a bit naive to think that the capacity of good and evil is based according to the political party one chooses o.O* All the characters do the same things but are discriminated for their political choices: About Lisbeth the author says she tries substances that are perhaps ""not very legal"", the daughter of the villain instead is ""an addict""; Mikael treats like garbage to her own daughter so ""he is not a good father""; the secret nazi father of other character does the same and is described as a monster whose abandonment inflicted pain to his children, although the son gets evil (rightist) and the daughter just afraid but good (leftist) anyway.* In Sweden ALL the women are feminists that are ALWAYS abused by rightists men, according to the made up statistics of the author they are a kind of slaves in Sweden. Women in this book fall in love always if you are leftist...* In Sweden ALL the non white migrants are good and nice men (even the ones in prison!), although conveniently their women are hidden so  we don't see retrograde attitudes from them that would change our opinion. This idea is naive as well, every man and woman is capable of good and evil. I understand Sweden is a country where feminism is very active politically, I really doubt each Swedish man is a monster and each non-white migrant an angel. One of the migrants is a Muslim man that has no problem to try to cheat his (invisible) wife with Lisbeth, a girl that looks underage and could be his daughter, but as he is migrant Lisbeth finds him automatically attractive.* Men cannot get in love because apparently that is harassment. Women choose and force the men into relationships, in the book Lisbeth commands Mikael to not reject her because that would be harmful to her self-stem... so it doesn't matter if he doesn't love her, he is just a man.* Mikael is incapable of love so he just obeys what women says, otherwise he would be an abuser. Sadly the conclusion is that he not even is capable to care for her daughter but the daughter loves him because he is... (yes?) leftist! xD* The characters are ""possessed"" by the author: they are talking and suddenly they start to insult people with rightist tendencies. I am apolitical so it is very tiring to read this diatribe.And so on and so on till the nausea... till it gets the focus of the story and when the case is showed as non-existent then the book deflates and we get a lot of filler pages showing how the world embraces leftist policies, Mikael's magazine is the most popular and all the nazis (everybody that doesn't agree with the politics of the author is called nazi) are dead so a happy end courtesy of Deus ex Machina and nothing else.This book was very promising but in the end I cannot avoid the elephant in the room: it is pretty discriminatory. I am not going to read other books by the author with the idea that your political choice and not your actions are the ones that speaks about your quality as a person. And my comparison to Dante is no casual, I have the suspicion through all Stieg Larsson's book that he fell in love with a young lady and he was rejected. The book seems (as the Divine Comedy) like trying to arrange a meeting in dreams with the loved one that in reality couldn't become to be.",,
Jay in Phoenix,"Reviewed in the United States on December 27, 2012",5 people found this helpful,5.0 out of 5 stars,Second time around,"I am on my second round of reading the Millennium Trilogy. I have seen all three Swedish movies and David Fincher's American movie of this title and greatly enjoyed them all. ""The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo"" is a first-rate mystery plus a social commentary on the victimization of many women in Sweden that doesn't interfere with the story at all (the original title in Swedish is ""Men Who Hate Women"").Lisbeth Salander is one of the most unique characters in fiction. She has been victimized since childhood but refuses to play the role of a victim. She is the perfect foil of the protagonist Mikael Blomkvist, an investigative journalist hired to look into the disappearance of a young woman 30-some years before. Salander is a Goth, a loner, a hacker, and a supremely talented researcher. Blomkvist takes her on as his research assistant when the job he is hired for starts to get complicated and dangerous.This is a long book (over 650 pages) and a wild ride. You will be glad it is that long as you don't want it to be over once you've started it. I can't recall a modern work of fiction I have enjoyed more than the Millennium Trilogy. All 2000 pages of it. However, this book works fine as a stand-alone novel. There are no loose ends at the end.",,
manndrake,"Reviewed in the United States on August 15, 2014",2 people found this helpful,4.0 out of 5 stars,A Fascinating Character,"I came to this book late.  It had been on the best seller lists for a long time and it filled the window of the local bookstore, and I passed it by.  When I did pick it up, I devoured it.  It is the story of a discredited investigative reporter in Sweden, who takes a job for a man who wants to find out what happened to his missing niece, many years ago.  Along the way, the reporter meets a reclusive computer hacker with a giant dragon tattooed across her back.  She agrees to help the reporter solve this cold case.  Much has been said about the poor writing of Stieg Larsson.  I agree that he sometimes has too many subplots going and he lets some just dissolve into thin air  This story suffers from the fact that the killer is such an ordinary person.  It takes some of the steam out of the climax.  But Mr. Larsson does build his scenes toward the climax, he raises the tension as the story goes on, and he has invented one of the most interesting characters in popular fiction.",,

J. Yu,"Reviewed in the United States on June 24, 2011",9 people found this helpful,3.0 out of 5 stars,I don't get the hype.,"I'm surprised so many readers have been willing to persist through the lengthy exposition and the huge cast of characters--with Swedish names, nonetheless--to finally get to the action. There's a lot of backstory to trudge through, and the first part of Blomkvist's investigation plods along, as we see him get up, make coffee, go for a jog, explore the village, eat a sandwich, read files, make coffee, go for a jog...I put the book down a few times in frustration or boredom but continued because I assumed there must be a huge pay off. Not really. After sorting through a whole warehouse full of people and a tangled net of subplots, I found the resolution of the central mystery rather anticlimactic and unsatisfying. The atrocities that are revealed in the book should be terrifying but aren't. The violence didn't make an emotional impact on me, probably due to the weak character development and poor writing. I don't know if this is just a bad translation or if the original prose was clunky (or maybe both), but many of the sentences are awkward, the dialogue is often wooden, and there's no spark to the language.A couple subplots are left unresolved, I assume to be picked up in the next installment. Lisbeth Salander is an interesting enough character I might read the next one--especially since I optimistically bought all three at one time--but I really don't understand why this book has won so many awards.",,
MB,"Reviewed in the United States on June 22, 2019",,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Good plot with lots of twists, depth, and a satisfying ending with one last twist.","The different threads of the plot were woven together well, albeit the character development was a little disruptive in the beginning. This, however, is always a necessity in the first book of any series and was actually done in an entertaining fashion. The level was a bit uneven, with some mundane parts going into significant detail while some of the key action was over in a paragraph or two. But overall, that worked to move the story on at a good pace while building the characters. I'm definitely looking forward to reading the rest of the novels.",,
J. Evans,"Reviewed in the United States on August 7, 2010",8 people found this helpful,2.0 out of 5 stars,Thumbs down for me,"I'm sorry but I gotta go with the negative reviewers on this one. This is a real mess of a book. It's greatest failing isn't that it's central, most interesting character, Lisbeth Salander, is relegated to a supporting role next to Mikael Blomkvist, the world's most boring sleuth since Jack Webb in the old Dragnet series. No, its worst failing is that it is over two thirds of the way through. It often happens that authors begin stories they have no idea how to finish. So they end up tacking on a conclusion that more times than not fails all that precedes it.Here, the mystery is solved, the murderer identified (He's is a real snoozer too by the way) only to be discarded along with the entire murder mystery plot of the first two thirds of the book just so the author can bring forward the Blomkvist vindication subplot with its attendant back-story baggage which had been dragging the story down from the beginning. By that time I'd had it with the annoying little milksop and didn't much care if he got vindicated or not.Where is Lisbeth, I kept asking?  Well, the pathologically introverted though brilliant sociopath - never comfortable with unfamiliar places or unfamiliar people - suddenly turns super con woman and hatches an elaborate bank fraud scam that has her jetting across Europe in designer clothes, speaking perfect Oxford English. Yeah, she's really smart and all. I get it. But come on. This isn't an ending. It's an underdeveloped hacker short story loosely stapled to the end of an unfinished mystery novel. Hackneyed is not too strong a word for this. Neither is anticlimactic, incongruous, or hamfisted.If you are interested in this book, take my advice. Skip it and rent the movie - the Swedish one. Yes, the movie shares many of the book's shortcomings, pig's ears being what they are and all. But Noomi Rapace makes an absolutely great Lisbeth. It's in Swedish but that doesn't matter because, trust me, reading English subtitles is less painful than reading Stieg Larrson's prose.",,
Charlotte R. Mitchell,"Reviewed in the United States on May 16, 2013",One person found this helpful,3.0 out of 5 stars,Too Much Violence - Less about Computer Hackers,"When I read that the book was about a computer hacker, I expected to find some interesting information about how the hacker's mind works and how the hacking is done.  I admire the intellectual capacity of a person who understands computers that well, but I would like the hacker to use his/her abilities for good purposes.  When there are such graphic descriptions of extreme violence in a book, the description of the book should state this so that a reader will be informed before making his/her decision about reading the book. I have to wonder why the author felt it necessary to go into such detail on the violence.  Some of the book held my interest, and I wanted to see what would happen next.  However, I found parts of it would just drag on and on and cause me to turn off my Kindle until I could cope with reading the book again.  To me the description of all the business ventures of the Vanger family and of Wennerstrom (along with the mention of so many bank accounts) was very boring.  When I am reading names with which I am not familiar, I don't recognize certain names as male and others as female.  It didn't help that Blomkvist called Erica ""Ricky"".  In my opinion way too many last names began with a B.  I wish the Kindle version would have had a list of characters with a brief description of each one and an easily accessible link to that list; Kindle's version could also provide such a link to the family tree the author included. I see that the Shelfari Community has put a list of characters on the amazon page for the book.",,
Mary Wood,"Reviewed in the United States on September 26, 2011",2 people found this helpful,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Starts very slow, but for good reason; unique writing style","(NO MAJOR SPOILERS HERE) - Seeing the first teaser for the Daniel Craig/Rooney Mara film I picked up the book expecting a high-octane action thriller. Turns out, surprisingly little to no octane but rather a psychological mystery well worth the ride if you stick to it.Part of that is owed to the writing style. You get to know the characters, especially Salander, not as much by peering into what is going on in their heads, but more through their actions. Being Asperger's myself, as Salander is suspected to be, it's definitely a unique way to get into the mind and character of an Aspie. When something bothers us we don't always react the same way most people do. So we get less of the traditional ""X really bothered Salander (emotion, emotion, swirling emotions)"" and instead we get more of ""Salander frowned and (action/what she does about it)."" It's the buildup of those actions and reactions from which a picture of this person gradually forms.The other reason for so much exposition is that it is a very character-driven mystery. When the aforementioned writing style does lead us into a high-octane sequence, one might almost miss it. We expect to see lots of capital letters and exclamation points and description of high emotion. Instead, the action sequences read almost like a matter-of-fact police report, describing coldly and simply what is going on. The ""octane"" therefore comes from what you know of the characters. ""Whoa! That was kind of out of character for this person!"" Subsequently, as the core mystery starts to unfold, what makes X creepy or Y something mysterious that you suddenly crave to know more about is what you know of the characters and personalities involved. It's knowing how the dysfunctional Vanger family disfunctions which gives the mystery its dimension.So we end up getting sucked into the mystery much the way the character of Blomkvist does: low expectations based on the dry start, but inexplicably, as details start to unceremoniously emerge, they light a spark that has us hungry to know more. If you require fast-action to hold your attention, this is not the book for you. If you want to stretch your brain a bit, get the action and emotion not from what is written on the page but from what you now know of the personalities involved, this book will not disappoint.",,
Davewise,"Reviewed in the United States on November 17, 2011",2 people found this helpful,5.0 out of 5 stars,An exciting and engaging mystery,"After hearing David Fincher was doing a movie based on this book, I decided to give it a try and I wasn't disappointed. It is a well-written mystery about a girl's disappearance many years ago which turns into a present-day terror. While the mystery itself drives much of the plot, the fascinating characters are what really drives the novel. The ""girl with the dragon tattoo"" is Lisbeth Salander, an introverted, anorexic, expert hacker who gets categorized as troubled and sent to a children's psychiatric hospital. Even as a young adult she is considered legally incompetent; one of her appointed guardians takes advantage of her sexually. Lisbeth is no weakling though and can be dangerous in self-defense. Despite some of her methods, it's easy to empathize with Lisbeth and cheer her on - in many ways she's a victim herself but she refuses to act like one.In some ways, the main character in the novel is actually Mikael Blomkvist, a financial journalist facing libel charges related to an article written for his magazine ""Millennium"". Just like Lisbeth, Mikael has his own flaws which helps make him feel real. Mikael receives an odd job offer from Henrik Vanger, the aged former CEO of a large corporation. Henrik wants Mikael to look into the decades old disappearance of his niece Harriet, whom Henrik believes was murdered by a family member. At first Mikael dismisses Henrik's suspicions, but before long he too gets wrapped up in the case. Discovering a number of new leads, eventually he enlists the help of Lisbeth after learning of how she was able to research Mikael's background for Henrik before he was hired. The story picks up a lot of steam with the new developments and includes some interesting twists. Overall I found the novel very enjoyable, even after I was able to predict part of the ending. There was more than enough to maintain my interest with the varied characters and plot twists.",,
Amazon Customer,"Reviewed in the United States on April 19, 2013",,3.0 out of 5 stars,Not the action and suspense I was expecting,"I love audiobooks that are full of suspense, action, and mystery, as they always keep my attention with the intrigue.  After hearing such positive and glowing reviews of this book, I may have set my expectations a bit high, because I did not find the level of enjoyment from this book that many others did.I found Blomkvist an interesting character, who puts his life on hold to help Henrik Vanger solve an unsolved mystery regarding his niece, Harriet.  Harriet disappeared suddenly, years ago, without any explanation and is hoping that Blomkvist can help him where the police couldn't.  Blomkvist does make headway on his investigation, but realizes quickly that in order to research everything properly he will need an assistant.  That is when he hires Lisbeth, the girl with the dragon tattoo.Lisbeth is an odd character who adds her own element to the story.  She has amazing investigative skills that make Blomkvist open his eyes to new possibilities.  As they unveil the mystery of Harriet's disappearance, they form not only a good working relationship, but also a solid friendship.  Not only do they solve the mystery, but confront a current day predator.  This part of the novel puts Blomkvist's life in danger, bringing Lisbeth to his rescue.I really was expecting more action and suspense from this novel, but the biggest part was solving the mystery from years ago.  One of my friends told me the next book was better, so I will probably listen to that one also, but I will wait for awhile.  With themes of family, secrets, and mystery, you may find more enjoyment than I did from this book.  I do recommend this book for lovers of a good mystery, but not if you want some action to go along with it.",,
Solipso,"Reviewed in the United States on January 7, 2012",2 people found this helpful,5.0 out of 5 stars,A fine mystery with a mesmerizing central character.,"You do not need to read the second and third volumes of Stieg Larsson's bestselling international trilogy. THE GIRL WITH THE DRAGON TATTOO is a complete story with a satisfying ending.What genre does this novel belong to? Before reading it, I was unsure. I supposed it was a high-tech action-suspense-thriller, like the Bourne trilogy. There is some tech: mobile phones and a good amount of laptop computer activity, though that's not HIGH tech. There's some sex and some action, but not a lot of either. As I read it, I learned that this novel most appropriately belongs to the genre of mystery. Its prose reminded me of Rex Stout or Agatha Christie, with background details about the setting and background details about members of a large family, from which the reader tries to identify the killer.What made this book a bestseller? The plot is not the answer. It is hackneyed. An investigator is hired to learn about the events of a murder, question family members, and solve the mystery. The setting is Sweden, a bit refreshing for me, but I'm sure the setting alone did not make this a bestseller. Nor did the unremarkable tech or action. No, what made it a bestseller is the charm of the heroine. As I absorbed myself in THE GIRL WITH THE DRAGON TATTOO, my best moments came as I learned about her.I won't go so far as to say that I ADORED her, but I guess my feelings were along that direction. At least for me--though other reviewers don't think so--she was bright, shiny, new, and original. But I don't want to describe WHY she was so. A description would spoil your own moments of discovery, which await your own reading.",,
My 2 Cents,"Reviewed in the United States on December 30, 2011",One person found this helpful,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Started out slow, but then packed a punch!","After falling for a clever hoax, financial journalist, Mikael Blomkvist is convicted of libel. Not only does he face a three month prison sentence, but his career in jeopardy as well.  Soon after, Henrik Vanger, an elderly, semi-retired executive of a prominent Swedish company hires him to investigate the disappearance of his great niece Harriet, who disappeared 36 years earlier at the age of 14.  Initially, Henrik asks him to write about the history of the Vanger family, but is clear that Blomkvist's real purpose will be to solve this decades-old case.  Henrik has been obsessed with having this case solved before he dies.  There has been no trace of her in all these years and it's assumed she is dead. However, every year on his birthday, he receives a mysterious gift of a pressed flower, like the ones his great-niece used to give him.As Blomkvist begins to dig into the Vanger history, he hires the smart, highly talented, Lisbeth Salander to help with the investigation. She looks like a punk-rocker, and she is both tough and brilliant, with a talent for computer hacking. She's also heavily-tattooed and antisocial.For me, this novel started off extremely slow first (150+ pages), and I couldn't understand what all the hype was about. The translation from Swedish wasn't always smooth either, and there are several subplots, but I was determined to finish it as we are planning to see the movie (today).  Once the story got off the ground,  it had me quickly turning the pages.  Each time one mystery seems solved, another one surfaces. The setting is Sweden, and the atmosphere always felt dark and cold -- perfect for this story. The character development, especially of the two main characters was fantastic.  Lisbeth was a fantastic character, even though she could be a downer at times. Blomkvist was the perfect compliment to her, in my opinion. I felt like I was inside their mind at times.Those who haven't read this one yet, should be aware that there are a couple of disturbing incidents of rape and other abuse against women. The story is definitely graphic at times.  If you aren't too disturbed as you read, by the end of this novel, I believe most readers will be anxious to read the (2) books which follow: The Girl Who Plays With Fire, and The Girl Who Kicked the Hornet's Nest.",VINE VOICE,
Justin Lee,"Reviewed in the United States on June 7, 2010",3 people found this helpful,5.0 out of 5 stars,Review for THE MILLENNIUM TRILOGY (Part 1 of 3),"Note: I'm trying to write this as a review of the entire Millennium trilogy, broken into three parts. For those who are wondering how the trilogy should be read, my opinion is to read them in order and back-to-back. Although Larsson does a fine job of re-introducing recurring characters, it helps to know their back story; and back-to-back because Larsson's cast of character is HUGE. I've written up a list of characters for the trilogy, which you are free to use and distribute as you wish ([...]). I also made a more condensed version ([...]) that removes all the minor or non-recurring characters. If you do read this trilogy and you're unfamiliar with Sweden (as I am), you might want a map of Sweden on hand or have Google Maps handy. It's not necessary, but it did help me picture things better in my head. This is especially true of the latter two books, which  explores Sweden a lot more. Google Maps is especially great for this because you can use Street View for many of the locations.THE MILLENNIUM TRILOGY (Part 1 of 3)The Girl With the Dragon TattooI heard of this book years ago from my mom. She had read it in Chinese, and I believe it had came out in Chinese before English. Since my mom has recommended me some dubious books in the past, I was wary of reading it. Then I saw ""Stieg Larsson"" and ""Dragon Tattoo"" popping up all over the place, and decided to go for it. I'm somewhat glad that I didn't pick this book up till now because that's allowed me to read the trilogy back-to-back. While that isn't necessary, it certainly makes it easier to keep track of things.DRAGON TATTOO reads like a ""whodunit"" mystery, and reminded me of the movie ""Gosford Park."" The protagonist is Mikael Blomvist, the gutsy financial reporter from Millennium magazine, who, in the beginning of the novel, has just lost a libel case against Wennerström, a businessman he had been investigating. As he ponders his fate for the near future, he gets a visit from a lawyer representing Henrik Vanger, a former mogul, who wants him to write a biography of his family. This writing job, however, is really just a pretext to allow Blomvist to do some investigation into a dark history of the family.Then there's Lisbeth Salander, the girl with the dragon tattoo, who is a freelance researcher for a security firm. She is portrayed as a mysterious, introvert, and strong-willed woman who has her unconventional means of getting information. Salander's and Blomvist's worlds will soon converge and become the key focus of the book.Here are a few things of note about Larsson's writing:He keeps the action going without putting in tedious descriptions of unnecessary details. He does enough to give life to the scene, but focuses on the important elements.He writes with a point of view, which is to say that, this isn't just your regular mystery novel. Larsson, himself a journalist, seems to know the inner workings of many Swedish institutions. Each of his book seems to broaden the focus of these institutions. For example, DRAGON TATTOO focuses mostly on independent journalism and the corporate world; PLAYED WITH FIRE focuses on the media, academia, and law enforcement; and ""Hornet's Nest"" focuses on secret government agencies (at least as far as I know; I'm still reading it). Larsson also has strong opinions about things going on in Sweden, in it comes through in his writing (most obviously in Blomvist's voice). It's a refreshing take on a traditional genre that I find really powerful.The cast of characters and the institutions can get overwhelming, especially if you really want to understand the connections between everything. Larsson also has the tendency of referring to his characters by their last name, the first name, and their nick names, so it helps to have it all fresh in your head. I would suggest being patient, because the payoff is well worth it. I was a bit stumped in the beginning of this novel, mostly because I had thought it was ""light reading,"" the type of book that you can read in small bits before you go to bed, or when you're on the subway. It turned out that, for me, it was easier to read it in large chunks, because it helps keep the information intact.Despite of the cast, the characters were all well-written, including the minor ones. Lesser authors would have reduced them to caricatures, but Larsson doesn't pull that here.The twists in this book were AWESOME. Several times I would say out-loud ""Oooooh"" and have to get up and take a breather (and I only do that when I'm excited by a book).Evidently, coffee is big in Sweden. :)So far, this is my favorite of the trilogy. It seems more like a standalone novel, and might even be seen as a prologue to the latter two books.",,
A. Langston,"Reviewed in the United States on July 23, 2010",3 people found this helpful,5.0 out of 5 stars,THREE STARS for Audiobook Product FIVE STARS FOR STORY/WRITING,"AUDIOBOOK PRODUCT REVIEWLet me start out by saying that the reason I'm only giving three stars is because I'm only reviewing the AUDIOBOOK PRODUCT  (as these are the product review pages).Simon Vance is a very good reader.  As a narrator he does great job of putting the emphasis where it belongs in each sentence and paragraph. With dialogue he gives each character a unique voice and he totally embodies the voices he chooses.  Since this is a translation I actually think I enjoyed having it read to me more than if I had read it in book form because I may have (just like with Tolkien) had the flow of reading interrupted by all those foreign place names and character names. Simon Vance speaks these with ease.If you are a consumer who intends to rip the audiobook CDs to your digital device there is something you need to know.  The tracks on the CDs are seemingly purposely tagged in a disordered fashion.  For example, when I ripped CDs 1, 3 and 4 on Itunes they ended up in the directory under /Stieg Larsson/The Girl With the Dragon Tatto.  When I ripped CDs 2,5 and 6 they ended up in the directory under /Compilations/Simon Vance/CD Tattoo.  The metadata on the tracks is not the same on every CD.  So once you rip the CDs you have to select all the tracks and re-enter the metadata to your liking so that all 13 CDs will have the same information.  It's tedious but not undoable.BOOK REVIEWI was riveted to through my entire listen to this book.  I found the non-mystery related exposition on the state of financial journalism interesting and very timely.  I found the side story regarding machinations at Millenium magazine very interesting.I didn't find the mystery very mysterious but I still enjoyed listening to the characters work through all of it.  I enjoyed learning about the rotten backstory of the rich industrialist family.  I enjoyed listening as the journalist worked through different clues.  I also liked the jump between scenes of the hero and heroine.I especially liked the social commentary on Sweden's mental health/social services system.  I liked how Lisbeth, with her ""issues"", was an embodiment of what happens to people when they are thrown around by ""the system"". But I also like how, even though she was thrown around by the system, she was not a victim.",,
Roger Angle,"Reviewed in the United States on August 10, 2010",3 people found this helpful,3.0 out of 5 stars,GREAT STORY BURIED IN DULL PROSE,"(8/11/2010) A sprawling, redundant, repetitive, insulting mess of a book. Like a crude first draft. Yet there is a great story buried here, under all the exposition. The book should've been cut by half, leaving out all the boring back-story, rewriting the clichés, and respecting the reader more. The (Swedish) movie makers did a great job of cutting through the crap. It's my favorite movie in years.For the book, someone should publish a guide to what to skip. I bought a paperback so I could mark it up, and I've crossed out about a third, which is not nearly enough. The most amazing thing to me is that so many people seemed to read all the dull exposition and not mind it. Overall, worth a look, but it's a long, painful slog. If you just want to enjoy the story, see the movie instead.BTW, when you find a real scene in the book, once every 100 pages or so, it can be terrific. At times you feel like you're living on that island with Mikael and the Vangers. You are living his search. At other times, the back-story is so slow and boring you almost wish you were dead.(8/13/10) The last week or so, since I finished reading ""Dragon Tattoo,"" I have had the strange urge to buy the next book in the series and keep on reading, just to keep living in that world, I guess. The book is strangely addictive, even though not well written. That must be something a bestseller does. Wish I knew how to do that.(10/12/14) Recently, I studied perhaps a dozen big bestselling thrillers and this was the best, oddly enough. It worked better for me on second reading. One reason for its popularity is there is no violence until about 200 pages in. Yet, there is plenty of suspense and the powerful devotion of its lead characters to trying to solve two compelling problems: the apparent murder of Harriet, the missing niece, and the restoration of Mikael Blomkvist's damaged career. The idea that one of the Vanger family murdered the lost girl is compelling, and the structure and character development are masterful, even though the writing is clunky.Obviously, the two lead characters are wonderful dramatic foils for each other, and  Lisbeth Salander is a wonderful underdog and damaged heroine. I greatly prefer a thriller like this to a Jack Reacher book or ""Gone Girl,"" both of which I found unbearable.",,
Amazon Customer,"Reviewed in the United States on April 1, 2011",6 people found this helpful,3.0 out of 5 stars,Mixed feelings about this one...,"Although this book was highly readable, I've got mixed feelings about it and don't really understand the hype surrounding this book.First, this book does contain quite a few scenes that depict graphic (often sexual) violence against women.  I also understand that the author attempted to bring attention to the issue of violence against women in Sweden.  Nevertheless, I don't think that this particular story constitutes the best vehicle for the message, as I would guess that most violence against women remains domestic violence rather than the serial killer-type depicted here.  Additionally, the (plot spoilers ahead) cover up of the multiple crimes against women in this book effectively ensures that the reader understands that these crimes pale in comparative importance to the financial conspiracy and Blomkvist's eventual redemption.Secondly, I found the characters underdeveloped.  Salander, of course, remains the most interesting character, but her limited expressiveness makes it difficult to understand Blomkvist's attraction to her.  Blomkvist himself, as the protagonist, seems flat and two dimensional.  His relationship with Salander seems contrived and cliche.  I honestly thought that the book would have been stronger if Blomkvist hadn't actually slept with nearly all of the novel's main female characters.  Overall, its hard to get a feel for who these people actually are and why we should care about them.This book is quite readable and moves quickly, but its overall message and lack of character development left me distinctly underwhelmed.  I think I'll pass on the rest of the series.",,
Tara Lohman,"Reviewed in the United States on December 29, 2011",3 people found this helpful,3.0 out of 5 stars,Four stories in......three?,"I read all these books and liked them.  I've seen the Swedish films, and just saw the new movie.  I've read some four star reviews and agreed with them, and read some one star reviews and agreed with them too, so at least I can say these books have something for everyone!  The action was good, the bad guys get theirs, and Lisbeth makes a fascinating study.  The best part of the trilogy, IMO, was her story, and how she eventually is defended and exonerated.  That alone would have made a fascinating book.  The author was, at the least, ambitious. He's got about four books ongoing in three volumes--Salander's story, Blomqvist's story, a treatise on violence against women, and an ongoing lesson on various aspects of journalism.One thing I've never been able to understand.....Vanger has a good mind, Blomquist and Salander are brilliant in their ways, and no one thought to wonder if the pressed flowers weren't being sent yearly as a message to Vanger that his niece was ok?  Even if the author had had Vanger pooh-pooh the idea, at least someone should have thrown it out there that it was meant to be a reassuring gesture to Henrik rather than years of emotional torture. It's the first thing I thought of when I read the book,  ""Oooh, I'll bet Harriet's still alive and she's sending these as a message to her uncle not to worry about her.""  You'd think one of those geniuses would have thought that up if it occurred to me, and I'm sure, to other readers as well.",,

WOW do the Swedes like coffee. The author mentions coffee on every page in every context he could.Would you like a cup of coffeePlease put on a pit of coffeeBlomvkist was having a cup of cofee as he read his notesAt the cafe he sat watching outside as he had his coffeeThey warmed up the cold coffee at 11pm and discussed the matterCOFFEE COFFEE COFFEEOh about the real topic of the book. Yes the book has some pretty violent and graphic material but, don't many books? What's so special about the heroine? She's a hacker - BIG DEAL.The main male character seems to be a Don Juan type and he has to try and have sex with any woman he comes into contact with? All men in this book come off as sadists and women haters, but I guess that's ok since the real title of the book in Sweden was Men Who Hate Women.As for the whole murder mystery, I find it quite implausible, once the whole mystery is revealed, that the murders could go on for so long without no one knowing anything into the matter. It seems HIGHLY implausible something like this could have gone on for so long. In the end, maybe I am just out of touch with this book.You really need to read all reviews especially the highest-rated negative review. I agreed with that negative review more than the highly positive one.Frankly, I'm quite shocked women love this book so much. I won't even bother reading the next two books in the series.

Nick,"Reviewed in the United States on April 21, 2012",2 people found this helpful,2.0 out of 5 stars,Extraordinary hype...average book,"A quick read of the first chapter and the generally rave reviews proved to be enough to goad me into picking up The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo with the serious intent of joining that illustrious and ever expanding club boasting of its literary greatness.  Admittedly, all the ingredients of a great story and page-turning experience were there: a disgraced journalist offered a chance at redemption, and revenge, through the mysterious offer of a retired businessman, etc.  What strikes me, now that I take the time to look back on the book in its entirety, is how poorly these components were executed and utilized.  I was left wondering if I had missed something, anything which explained why the novel didn't ""come alive"" for me as it had for so many others while only the The New York Times review made me feel sane for not gushing hyperbole over Larsson's work.  I figured a million Swedes couldn't be wrong but, as it turns out, I was.It may be somewhat of a misnomer to use the word ""complaints"" as most negative things about the book are really just disappointments.  The biggest letdown was how thoroughly unsatisfying the story was.  That first chapter left the impression that a whirlwind of intrigue and mystery was due to sweep me away at any moment; instead the first 40% of the book consisted primarily of uninteresting filler about such disparate and unimportant things as what certain characters were eating for lunch, the usefulness of a certain spreadsheet program, and the technical specifications of a particular laptop.  These digressions could have been forgiven if the rest of the book were to have made up for it in even the slightest fashion, but it sadly did not.  The story is so paper thin and cliche riddled that its almost an embarrassment to say that I plowed through to the end of what could probably have been an episode of CSI: Miami.  The climax leaves the reader with very little satisfaction for having been dedicated enough to keep going, and the revelation of the villain is almost entirely predictable because the author seems to have gone out of his way to drop hints just short of describing the character as the one with the noticeable mustache, top hat, and penchant for tying things to railroad tracks.All of this escapes the novel's main character which is not the girl with the dragon tattoo but is rather middle-aged journalist Mikael Blomkvist who is emblematic of how flat and dense the characters are.  He is, like most everybody else in the book, a reactionary only.  There is literally nothing in the book that gives the impression that he is a skilled investigator or in any way possesses superior abilities to any other guy walking by on the sidewalk, and, as luck would have it, the story proves just how unremarkable he is.  Events happen, Blomkvist muses on it for a while and then waits until the next event takes place.  Indeed, the big break in the story comes not from Blomkvist but rather by an incredibly random and fortunate visit from his daughter who is only really mentioned at that one instant in the novel.  As I said, Blomkvist is the poster boy for the larger problem faced by all of the characters: they leave you with no reason to ""root"" for them.  Even the title character, who is perhaps somewhat more sympathetic, is still so thoroughly pidgeonholed that one expects the next big twist to be that she has feathers and can fly.  When so many books can offer characters, stories, and experiences that are so rich and nuanced The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo feels strangely antiquated and not with the patina of a classic quality that continues to endear so many older works to our hearts.I wanted so much to like this book, but the myriad disappointments were so inescapable that I found myself being annoyed with the book for significant amounts of time.  The wasted capital of all the good ideas that could have made the book truly remarkable is what ultimately sank the entire experience, though a mostly superfluous first third of the book didn't help much.  I imagine that perhaps some of the book's appeal and wild popularity in Sweden was that it touched on themes and topics very germane to that country and which are somewhat less prominent here.",,
Craig Wood,"Reviewed in the United States on September 12, 2013",,4.0 out of 5 stars,Stick with it and you'll be rewarded,"""The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo"" is a little bit like my first car -- it's slow to get started, but once it gets going it moves along just fine.  I didn't lose faith during the early chapters of this book -- I knew things would pick up eventually.  And sure enough the tedium early in the story quickly turns into a plot that's fast-paced, engaging and hard to walk away from.Set in Sweden, this murder-mystery centers around a disgraced journalist, Mikael Blomkvist, who's hired by an aging industrialist to solve a missing-person case some three decades old.  After reluctantly accepting the offer, Blomkvist hires a social outcast (the tattoo girl) as his research assistant.  Together they uncover enough dark secrets and unspeakable truths to make your skin crawl.  The story is violent at times, and unsettling on many levels.  I haven't seen the movie yet, but I suspect that it could be a little difficult to watch.I'm glad that this is part of a trilogy.  To be sure, the first book is a little rough around the edges.  The glacial pace early in the book sets the table for some unlikely scenarios deeper into the plot.  ""The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo"" has its share of flaws.  But with two more books in the trilogy, I look forward to stories that are more polished, and still very suspenseful.",,

Dave Edmiston,"Reviewed in the United States on October 20, 2010",2 people found this helpful,5.0 out of 5 stars,Outstanding,"My wife told me I had to read this.  That's not always a good start, but I trust her.  My mom said she was fascinated by it too (except for ""all the nasty parts"").  Hmm.  That's enough to raise a yellow flag in my mind, but I decided to give it a whirl.My first impression was ""how am I going to keep all these names straight?""  Most of the characters in this who-dunnit are from the Swedish ""Vanger"" family.  I'm afraid it was a bit of a challenge for me to keep the names straight.  Some of them are even tough for an American reader like me to recognize as male or female.  There are a few family tree images in the book, but I read this on my Kindle and they were too small to be legible.  Luckily it's easy to search on the Kindle, so I could find the fist spot in the story where the character was introduced and remind myself who the character was.My next impression was how fascinating the Swedish translation was.  The translator did a great job of translating the idioms without losing the Swedish flavor.  I'm afraid the translator speaks better English than I do though.  This actually presented a bit of a challenge, because some of the vocabulary was very advanced.  I had to look up a number of words in the dictionary, which isn't such a bad thing--personal enrichment and all.Once the story got going and once I got used to nearly everyone in the story being named Vanger, I realized I was hooked.  Larsson really takes the reader for a ride through a very complex story with lots of interesting characters and location changes.I recommend any American readers keep a dictionary nearby and visit Google Maps to peruse Swedish geography and see where all the action takes place.  Viewing the locations really adds to the experience.My final impression was ""how can he possibly end this story?""  There were so many nested plots and sub currents--like a set of stacking Russian babushka dolls.  This was a treat, because it gave the story so many different endings.  I find this much more gratifying than a simple THE END.  But alas, the end wasn't the end.  Like a nervous chain smoker, I put this book down and started right up with The Girl Who Played with Fire.

Zeek,"Reviewed in the United States on August 15, 2011",One person found this helpful,4.0 out of 5 stars,Now I get it!,"Hard to grade this one- where as most of it was totally amazing, there is the beginning and the end that pulls it down for me because really, the best part of the story is when the protags were chasing down a killer- which only happens in the middle of the story, oddly enough. (The beginning and ending is almost another story all together!)Bestselling The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo begins with investigative journalist Mikael Blomkvist being hung out to dry for a piece he wrote that went horribly wrong. Through much of the beginning and to a lesser extent, the ending when Blomkvist gets his revenge for the happenings in the beginning, my eyes began to cross at the seemingly pointless blahdy blah blah of Larsson explaining how Blomkvist got into his current predicament.But really it was Blomkvist's desire to hide away from his circumstances that made him accept a job offer from eccentric former captain of industry, Henrik Vanger- a frail old man haunted by the disappearance of a long gone relative- that brings us to the exciting part. So I guess I can make the bridge as to why it began the way it did.Meanwhile we get to meet Lisbeth Salander, a brilliant but socially awkward researcher for a private investigator, who just happens to be assigned the task of investigating Blomkvist for the Vanger family. She's secretive, sullen, punked out, and- of course- tatooed , but she does superb work. However, she finds herself distracted from her assignment when her guardianship is changed and taken over by a loathsome individual. (An individual on whom she exacts some spectacular revenge! At this point in the novel, I literally sat up, bug-eyed then dug in and didn't look up till my eyelids refused to stay open late into the night!)Indeed it was this insight into her character that ignites the novel and doesn't let up until the ending, especially when she eventually joins Blomkvist covertly reinvestigating the mystery surrounding Vanger's beloved niece's death under the guise of chronicling his familys' checkered history. (Btw, this part of the story totally reminded me of a Criminal Minds episode, one of my favorite tv shows!)Murder, intrigue, sex and violence- what more can you ask for in a mystery-thriller? It's no surprise this little beauty's been hitting the must read/bestseller lists for forever now.Through his body of work, Larsson ruthlessly exposes perhaps some purveying attitudes of violence toward women and anti-semitim... attitudes he must have felt were being swept under the carpet of Swedish society. I love how he boldly empowers Lisabeth in a way few women would have the intelligence and courage to pull off, yet wraps her in a vulnerability that many woman can relate to. The second protag, Blomkvist, is a man-ho to be sure, but something about his innate nobility makes him extremely likeable too.If it wasn't for the slooooooow beginning I would have totally given this a 5 star. But I more than really liked it- so lets split the difference with 4.5 out of 5! :)",,

She is a mysterious person with secrets of her own.In the process of the ""wild goose chase"" of searching for new leads, Blomkvist decides he needs an investigative assistant to help him, and takes on Lisbeth Salander as his associate--after discovering that she prepared a report on him prior to Vanger's offer to him.  Her thoroughness impressed him.The two of them soon find some leads, and a lot more clues that suggest a serial killer may be on the loose.  Meanwhile, someone nearby on the island is sending very dark messages which suggest that the two may have zeroed in on some of the answers.What thread are the investigators beginning to unravel, and how does it connect to Harriet's disappearance?  What unexpected danger lurks nearby?The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo was a thrill ride that kept me reading late into the night.  In the beginning, I was slow to connect with the characters and the story.  A lot of initially confusing details kept me checking and rechecking to make sure I understood what was happening.  The Swedish names and places were also difficult to distinguish from one another at times, but once I got past the first 50 pages (I am guessing, since it was on the Kindle), I was hooked.  Now I am very eager to read the next book in the trilogy.  I would love to discover the hidden layers of Lisbeth's character, and I suspect there is a lot more to her story.I'm choosing four stars for this one and plan to order the next one right away.",TOP 1000 REVIEWER VINE VOICE,
sara miller,"Reviewed in the United States on January 27, 2011",,5.0 out of 5 stars,Engrossing,"If there are still any readers out there who haven't picked up Stieg Larsson's, The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, you are missing out. The only benefit to your delay is that you can read all of the books back to back. But do not delay, these books are the most addictive, well rendered and original series to come along in awhile if not ever.Only you wouldn't know that from the first few pages which begin as Mikael Blomkvist, a respected financial journalist loses a libel suit imparting a lot of financial journalism analysis and veered towards dull. But when his potential colleague, Lisbeth Salander enters the arc; the story heats up. Together they attempt to solve a decade old murder mystery, personal problems, and Blomkvist's reputation. It is a lengthy period of story before the two intersect but by then it's hopeless-- you too will be one of the series' millions of international fans.The story incorporates a lot of life detail. You will know what the characters ate, how many cigarettes they smoked and what they were wearing on any given day in the story which adds a lot to the characters and setting. So by the end of the book the characters feel like people you know and the settings like places you've been. The result is magic.Lisbeth is a completely different kind of protagonist and without a doubt the key to the series success. She's a tattooed renegade hacker with a complicated back story and an even more intricate moral code. Her refreshing distinctions guarantee her a spot on the beloved characters of literature list. Her no nonsense proactive spirit forces one to rally around her, and on her shoulders the story is propelled to its conclusion. It's unexpected yet delicious element that this admittedly odd young lady upstages the charismatic and sexy Blomkvist who the story is built around.Like a potato chip, you won't be able to just read Dragon and not subsequent efforts: The Girl Who Played with Fire or The Girl Who Kicked the Hornet's Nest. And that's a good thing because some of the storylines from Dragon are not satisfactorily resolved in this novel, but are picked up again in both of the series' follow ups.I urge any of you hold outs to grab a copy today.The audio book version I listened to was superbly read by Simon Vance who brings a lot to any reading on his own account.

Laura Stone,"Reviewed in the United States on February 13, 2012",,4.0 out of 5 stars,Very good reading...,"If you can laugh at the occasional digs at ""American tourists"" (and we complain about foreign tourists, too-but you get the feeling this author had a bad experience with American tourists)  throughout all three books you will find that these are enjoyable yet disturbing stories; characters that are odd yet persona's that you will find yourself relating to and finding people that you personally know who remind you of Blomkvist, Salander, Wu, Eriksson, Armansky, etc...I am sad that Larsson is no longer around (died in 2004) to continue to write about these characters as the stories are very well written...however, they do feel a bit rushed at certain points and I did find some inconsistencies that good editing should have corrected; with that said, I definitely feel sad that these characters will never be heard from again. it would have been interesting to see how much deeper we could have delved into Salander's interesting life and perhaps learn more of her twin sister. I have to point out to those who are trying to decide if these stories are for them...if you have an open mind about open marriages, lesbianism and sadism then you won't have any problem reading these stories - and I say ""these"" because there are three books to the series, Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, The Girl Who Played With Fire and The Girl Who Kicked The Hornet's Nest..and read them in that order or you will be lost. You also get the feeling with the titles of these books that the author might have been a fan of Lillian Jackson Braun's ""The Cat Who..."" series; it would have been interesting to see how far he would have gone with ""The Girl Who..."" Anyway, definitely not books for Teens or Tweens or anyone younger, probably not for some adults, either...but if you are not too sensitive or prudish you will certainly enjoy The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo (and the other two books, as well)",,
LH422,"Reviewed in the United States on March 25, 2011",One person found this helpful,4.0 out of 5 stars,The Horrors of Violence against Women,"Having heard so much about this book I felt obligated to read it and see for myself why it has generated so much buzz. As someone who didn't know a tremendous amount about the story going in, I found the book to be much more violent and horrifying than I expected.The book consists of two storylines involving disgraced financial reporter Mikael Blomkvist, and socially-inept hacker Lisbeth Salander. Together the two are trying to uncover the mystery surrounding the death of corporate heiress Harriet Vanger, and expose the financial misdeeds of a prominent tycoon. I was much more taken with the Vanger mystery than with the story about corporate corruption. That was rather dry.One of Larsson's larger objectives in this book is clearly to highlight the disturbing pervasiveness of violence against women. All of the significant violence in the book is gendered, and is perpetrated against female victims. One of its victims is co-protagonist Lisbeth Salander. She is certainly an interesting character, one who is uncomfortable with what many of us might consider basic sociability. She is also a woman who has endured much abuse, and that makes her essential to Larsson's larger point. One of Salander's most significant problems is that legally she is considered a ward of the state. She had been in this position as a child without competent parents, but her status as a legal dependent was allowed to continue into her adulthood. The fact that an adult who earns her own money, holds a job, and is capable of managing the basic elements of day-to-day life can be legally alienated from her money and her basic legal rights is, quite simply, frightening. Clearly Larsson is making an argument against the institution of guardianship. I was unclear if the portion of the text which explain guardianship were part of Larsson's original text, or if they were added by the translator for the non-Swedish audience.This is not the most amazing book I've ever read, but it's a book I'll certainly think about for some time. I suspect I'll read the next two books in the trilogy, as long as I can stomach the violence. Larsson does not glorify the horrific violence about which he writes, but it is, undeniably, difficult to read.",,Top Contributor: Coloring
Cheryl Stout,"Reviewed in the United States on July 10, 2010",2 people found this helpful,5.0 out of 5 stars,Trilogy - Tattoo Torment Fired with a Little Hornet Venom,"Call me narrow-minded if you will but I usually do not like non-American English books especially translated books.  I tend to lean towards books that I have some point of reference to and can relate to, even if it is just the written vernacular.  That stated, ""The Millennium Trilogy"" as ""the Girl with the Dragon Tattoo""; ""The Girl Who Played With Fire"" and ""The Girl Who Kicked the Hornets' Nest"" translated by Reg Keeland (aka Steven T. Murray) have come to be known by is extraordinary.  The locale - Sweden - was a little difficult.  There were a lot of very unfamiliar town and place names that were unknown and unpronounceable to me.  But it didn't seem to matter as I read.  The story pulled me along.  I liked the translation (I guess some people haven't) but maybe I don't know enough to know better.  I just know that Larsson's books, through Keeland, were astonishingly clear and flowed easily. SPOILER ALERT:Violent, disturbing, gut wrenching -- yes, all of these things and more.  I would not consider these for children to read at all.  Just about every type of abuse is written about VERY graphically in these books.  But the subjects are not being glorified - far from it. They are included to explain and clarify the near destruction of a human being and her triumph in spite of all.""Tattoo"" I liked probably the best.  It read like an old fashioned English murder mystery to me updated to the 21st century.  Genius heroine who is very hard to like at times, abuse, serial killer, unusual sleeping arrangements (I'm sure to some).""Fire"" was very graphic.  Gore, abuse, lesbian sex, insane villains, skewed senses of right and wrong in the bad guys AND the good guys. But compelling and explains a lot of the other two books.""Hornets"" started out slow for me.  I guess after the roller coaster ride of the first two books, when this one started out at a more normal pace it seemed to drag.  But persevere because it is definitely worth it.  There is a lot of politics/history at the beginning of this book.  Larsson was an investigative journalist and you can see some of that more clearly in this book.Larsson died too young - of a heart attack.  I have read (and of course I believe everything I read) that he was almost finished with book four of this series with books 5-10 outlined but because of inheritance issues it is unlikely that any more will be published.  The world lost a true literary treasure when Stieg Larsson died.  A lot of people aren't going to want to read his books -too violent, too painful.  But he was an author that a whole world is reading and will be reading far, far into the future.

Terry Mesnard,"Reviewed in the United States on September 28, 2009",2 people found this helpful,5.0 out of 5 stars,A great mystery with a not-too-surprising resolution,"The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo is a fairly deceptive novel.  When I first began reading it, I didn't know if I'd be able to continue.  After a mysterious setup which I figured would show up later as one of the central mysteries in the book, the novel dropped into drudgery.  This slow battle through a basic setup, which had me struggling to continue, belied the depth and pacing of this fantastic ""locked room mystery.""As the story continued, paving the way for a handful plots involving a reporter, an aging businessman and a mysterious female private investigator, I found myself turning page after page, trying to piece together exactly what happened.  Ostensibly, The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo is about the mystery of a missing woman named Harriet.  Her uncle, now in his 80s and presumably close to death, has driven himself to the edge of sanity, obsessively pouring through the police accounts of the fateful night.  You see, Harriet seemingly vanished into thin air.  Her body was never found, either alive or dead, there's no real motive for her disappearance and it's presumed by both her uncle, Henrik Vandar, and a police investigator close to the case, that she was murdered.  Further complicating the mystery is the fact that every year, on Henrik's birthday, someone taunts him by sending him a pressed flower, in the same tradition that Harriet did prior to her disappearance.This drives Henrik to hire a disgraced reporter named Blomkvist.  Blomkvist agrees to live at Henrik's estate to do some digging, putting a fresh pair of eyes on the mystery, under the guise of writing an autobiography on Henrik. But this is only the first 100 or so pages.  As the story drives further toward its conclusion, it twists and becomes something more.  While the ultimate reveal of the ""whodunit"" probably isn't too terribly surprising, the scale and the strength of Larsson's writing helps the material rise up to terrific heights.  There's more to the story than the central mystery: What was once a story about a vanished girl becomes more focused on bigger issues like murder and sexual violence, but also invokes a compelling examination of society, specifically focusing on Sweden.Author Stieg Larsson died before his manuscript could be published.  When he was alive, he was a political activist and spent a large portion of his time exposing Swedish extreme right, racist and pro-Nazi organizations.  It's obvious that The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo reflects his thoughts and intent. Consider the fact that the Swedish title of the book is Män som hatar kvinnor, which roughly translates to ""men who hate women.""  Then, consider that each section of the book begins with a statistic: ""Eighteen percent of the woman in Sweden have at one time been threatened by a man,"" or ""Forty-six percent of the women in Sweden have been subjected to violence by a man.""  As each part of the book goes by, the threat in these statistic escalates until its final conclusion.  In this way, a book of fiction, deliciously deep and interesting as a thriller and a whodunit, also has moral and societal implications.  In some ways, this book (and presumably the Millennium trilogy as a whole) is a perfect legacy for Larsson's beliefs and his actions.",VINE VOICE,
debra crosby,"Reviewed in the United States on December 16, 2008",4 people found this helpful,4.0 out of 5 stars,A Mystery with Few Stereotypes,"Since many reviews of this book already explain very well the plot and characters, I'll avoid going into too much detail about all that and just set out the reasons I liked this book.  First of all, I seldom read mysteries anymore, although I read them when I was younger, primarily because I find them often too predictable and full of sterertypical characters and plot lines.  However, this book intrigued me because, from what I read about it, it was different -- a mystery with many twists, few stereotypes.I found that, once I became involved in the story (and I tried not to let the complexity of the details -- and there are many -- intimidate me) I was hooked.  The characters -- Mikael, Lisbeth and even the members of the sometimes repulsive Vanger Clan -- were interesting and I cared about what happened next to all of them, even the rotten ones.The mystery of the disappearance of a young girl 40 years before, the obsession of her uncle that led to his hiring a shamed journalist to solve the mystery in hopes that he could thus allow himself to die in peace, the complexity of the world the Vanger family created and lived in, to say nothing of the dark details of Lisbeth's existence and the society which gives rise to greed and violence -- all of these elements were fascinating and woven together with imagination and intelligence.This is a mystery with some depth, that sharply comments on man's tendencies to evil, as well as to good.  The dark underside of life moves constantly below the surface, often breaking through in horrible fashion.Once the story gets going, the reader will find his mind engaged and working overtime.  I decided not to worry that I didn't always know which Vanger was which -- it all worked out, ultimately.  The business dealings, Nazi-esque elements, the suspense and the slow unraveling of the tale all worked together to make a fascinating morality tale, as well an entertaining yarn.Lisbeth Salander is a character unlike any I've seen in a long time.  Her complexity and vulnerability do battle with her raw courage and cynicism and she is as sympathetic as a tough tattooed young woman with multiple body piercings can be.  She is hard to get to know, but I found myself wanting to understand her.  Her story is key to the meaning of the whole book, I feel.I recommend this, especially to anyone who loves a mystery with complexity and depth.  Much fun, yet thought-provoking.  My favorite kind of book.",,
Jacopo,"Reviewed in the United States on December 29, 2010",,4.0 out of 5 stars,A decent crime thriller,"I was not really sure what to think going into The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, the adaption of Stieg Larsson's best-selling Swedish novel. I am not really a fan of crime or mystery novels, but this book has gotten so much attention that I had to check it out. The story follows two protagonists. Mikael Blomkvist is a middle-aged financial journalist who, after being convicted of libel against a very powerful Swedish financier, has been hired to investigate the mysterious disappearance of industry magnate Henry Vanger's niece, Harriet, some 40 years prior. The eponymous Lisbeth Salander is a 24-year old covert researcher who is initially hired to investigate Blomkvist.It takes a little wihle to get going, but after some initial character development Larsson is able to progress the story enough where I started to gain interest. I did have a lot of trouble discerning all of the different characters in the book, which is populated with numerous references to cousins, half cousins, uncles, fathers, etc who make up the Vanger family. It wasn't until the last 100 pages of the story that I actually thought I had everyone figured out. Larsson explores strong themes of sexual depravity and misogyny (as alluded to by the book's original Swedish title - ""Men Who Hate Women"") which ultimately form the theme of the entire story. In contrast, Larsson also provides an unusual sexual context around Blomkvist, Salander, and several other character's lives that may be unusual and off-putting to American readers. Partly because of this, I never really found myself caring too much for Blomkvist or Salander the way an author should hope for. Blomkvist is not very likable and Salander comes off as a bit of a brat, even though it's clear her development is surrounded by past childhood sexual trauma.The method of the investigation into Harriet's disappearance is rather dull and lackluster. There certainly were no moments of surprise or shared excitement between Blomkvist and the reader, as one might find in a Sherlock Holmes novel. Blomkvist follows a trail of clues that seem more concerned with luck and happenstance than from any individual talents. With 40 years of investigation, shouldn't the police or the Vanger family have stumbled onto the same path he now follows? Ultimately, the disappearance of Harriet itself is interesting enough that I was able to read through the story without losing interest or growing bored, and I was satisfied with the (initial) conclusion. The main flaws of ""Girl"" come from Blomkvist and Salander. Does Blomkvist care about Salander? Is he just interested in her and the other characters in the story for sex or does he actually have feelings for anyone? Does Salander care about anyone? And why should I care about Blomkvist if he doesn't care about anyone else? His and everyone else's strange intimate relationships might be par for the course in Sweden, but they don't work on American readers. And if that's the case, I can't necessarily fault Larsson for living in a different culture, but it does affect my opinion of the story and ultimately will likely lead to my decision not to read the sequels.Finally, the book's second biggest flaw comes at the end. Not with the conclusion to the Harriet Vanger mystery, but with the next 75 pages or so, which detail Blomkvist's attempted revenge against the financier who led to his libel conviction. While this was an underlying plot to the main story of the Vanger case, it did not deserve such a large portion of the book, and felt out of place after I had satiated myself with the Harriet Vanger conclusion. It's almost like the end of a 90's action movie, where you think the story is over until the villain comes back from the dead for one final scene, only it takes several scenes, and it's not the main villain from the movie, but his cousin Steve who briefly had a few scenes in the beginning of the movie. Larsson should have cut this from the book and added it to the beginning of the sequel. It's just not as powerful as the story he previously takes us on.""The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo"" is an interesting read, but poor character development and a slightly jumbled plot prevent it from being the acclaimed novel I was expecting, and I think it's more worthy of a passing summer read than the ""must-read novel"" it's been hailed as.",,

""The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo"" is an excellent work of literature where the author pens the dramatic events of the Vangar Tragedy and brilliantly introduces Lisbeth and Mikael two characters with different ideas and behaviors. Mikael Blomkvist instantly charms the reader with his wit, brilliance, and of course prowess with the ladies. Lisbeth Salander on the other hand is a social misfit and can best described as brilliant computer hacker with a terrible taste in music and wardrobe. Although she mostly associates herself with punk/goth friends she is like a stray cat never allowing people to close to her life. During the course of the book both characters are forced to work together to solve the mystery disappearance of sixteen year old Harriet Vangar who was last seen at a family gathering 30 years ago. During the course of the novel other tragic events shape Blomkvist and Salander's lives which eventually sets up the plot for the next two books in the series. I am not a fan of crime/mystery or financial novels however Larsson does a great job in incorporating all theses facets without making the story dull.

SR,"Reviewed in the United States on June 12, 2011",,5.0 out of 5 stars,Blockbuster Indeed,"I've been meaning to pick up this title for a while, since it seemed as if everywhere I went people were talking about it, both in the U.S. and abroad. I didn't expect it to be as...haunting...as it turned out to be, but let me say that I am very content that I picked up the title.The book begins by introducing the reader to three main characters: Mikael  Blomkvist, Lisbeth Salander, and Henrick Vanger. Blomkvist is a financial journalist at the very bottom of his career after falling from grace and being sentenced to jail for libel against a corporate hegemon. Clearly, the reader is led to believe there is more to this portrayal of a protagonist than originally appears, as Blomkvist refuses to defend himself in court. Salander, on the other hand, is a brilliant, tatooed, computer hacker with an eclectic lifestyle. A ward of the court, and socially awkward, Salander is ultimately led to conduct a personal investigation into Blomkvist on behalf of the opulent, elderly, yet somewhat fallen-from-grace Henrick Vanger. Vanger ultimately entrusts Blomkvist with a monumental task, with Salander eventually being drug into the web while grappling with her own personal demons.Simply, Vanger wants to know, what happened to his niece Harriet, decades lost after a party at the Vanger estate. The caveat to the story is this: on the day Harriet disappeared, presumably murdered, there was an accident on the bridge leading from the Vanger estates, located on an island. Blomkvist moves to the Vanger estate, with the now elderly cast, and is left with a realization: given the accident, only a finite number of people (those on the island with Harriet at the time of its occurrence) could have murdered her. Absent a body, given the chance to unravel a decades-old cold case with very little evidence, Blomkvist soon realizes that his chance at redemption depends upon finding the fate of Harriet.As Blomkvist and Salander team up to unravel this mystery, events take a drastic turn, as they realize that one of the Vanger family is likely responsible for Harriet's disappearance. On the island, with the Vanger family members, Blomkvist and Salander delve deep into a family's mystery, only to find that the skeletons in THIS particular closet may not be as dead as they appear, indeed, they may even be willing to commit heinous new crimes to cover up a crime decades in the past.An A-grade mystery with a twist ending.

Like many books of this type, the hype often gets out of control and reader expectations skyrocket, which seems to be the case here.  Numerous people recommended the book to me, and all seemed to think it was brilliant.  I was eager to finally read it, as I am a fan of Scandinavian mystery novels, such as the Martin Beck series.  Unfortunately, I thought that ""The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo"" was good but not the masterpiece some seem to think it is.If you can overlook the hype, then it's a highly readable, solid mystery novel.  As noted by many other reviewers, the book probably could have used some judicious editing and tightening.  In particular, details about Lisbeth's background and life are parsed out over and over again, becoming highly repetitive and not really adding much new.  I felt the same way about details given for other characters as well.  On the other hand, it's hard to knock a book for providing character development, especially in a genre where it is so often lacking.  Plus, I did end up actually caring about the two lead characters, which again is not always the case with mystery novels.  The other main issue I had with the novel is that I didn't really become very invested in the main plot/mystery until about halfway through, when the pieces started to merge.  Getting through the first half was a bit of a chore, but the book did improve significantly after that.In the end, I liked but did not love ""The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo.""  The novel could have been shortened and not lost anything crucial.  However, the book did intrigue me enough that I immediately downloaded the next one in the series onto my Kindle.  I guess getting me invested in the characters worked.",,
sb-lynn,"Reviewed in the United States on June 28, 2010",,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Mediocre mystery , great characters","Very brief summary (since this has been reviewed so many times) and review.The setting of this novel is Sweden and the timing is just a few years into the 21st century. The story features two wonderful characters - one of them is Carl Mikael Blomkvist, an honorable investigative journalist who is going to be imprisoned for three months for libel of a corrupt industrialist.  Blomkvist is given an offer he can't refuse - pretend to be doing a family biography of the venerable Vanger family, while in reality try to solve the apparent murder of one of its members, a young girl named Harriet Vanger back in the 1960s. In exchange, he would be given a large amount of money and proof of the industrialist's guilt. This offer is made by Henrik Vanger, now 82 years old who desperately wants to find out what happened to his niece Harriet before he dies.The other lead, and now one of my favorite characters of all-time, is Lisbeth Salander. She is seemingly anorexic (she's not), 4'11, tattooed, pierced, and fierce as all hell. She has had a brutal upbringing (we are only given bits and pieces of her past, although we know about her horrific present.) Lisbeth seems to have Aspergers Syndrome, which turns out to be a mixed bag. She has trouble understanding the emotions of normal people and cannot seem to get close to anyone - she see's the world in a different way. And this is where her condition turns out to be a plus - she can analyze data instinctively and instantly. She is an expert computer hacker, and investigator. She has a photographic memory to boot.This book has Mickael and Lisbeth teaming up with each other, at first through necessity and because of business reasons, and later because they develop a mutual bond - the only real human bond Lisbeth seems to have had. (Outside of visiting her mother in a nursing home - we are not sure about their relationship.)The mystery itself is so-so, and in fact I didn't buy it at all. If this book had stock mystery genre detectives and investigators it would not have been the success it is. What makes the book so good are these two characters, and the interplay between them, and by the time we finish we don't want the book to end because we don't want our relationship with these characters to end.The good news is that there are two more books in the series.

Henrik Vanger has been obsessed with the mystery all that time because someone keeps sending him a single pressed flower on his birthday, just as Harriet did.  Is the killer taunting him?I found the book to be very suspenseful, with more than a dash of Peyton Place in it once the author starts delving into the Vanger Family.  What I liked best was that the mystery was layered.  There is more than one bad guy to be uncovered, and many twists along the way.  Both protagonists, Lisbeth and Blomkvist, are engaging, well developed and interesting.  I find that some of the best authors are those that use prior career experience to base their writing on.  Grisham is a lawyer and that is borne out in his thrillers.  Larsson was a journalist - and it shows here.  Blomkvist is credible and realistic.  However, Grisham sometimes got caught up in legal technobabble, and Larsson falls into a similar trap.  He gets caught up in description and minutia.  Every place is described in excruciating detail even to the point of distracting the reader.  However, it isn't enough to ruin the book, but I did find myself skimming more than once.One last note, some have described the book as having extreme violence. I was wary, but found the warning exaggerated.  There are two scenes which were disturbing, but no more than you would find in many mysteries (and not even as horrific as the opening of Grisham's A Time to Kill: A Novel).  Overall, I found this to be a gripping suspense thriller, well worth it to those who enjoy the genre and with a satisfying ending.  I've already started the second book.  I'd also like to see both movies - the Swedish version, and the US one currently in production.",TOP 1000 REVIEWER,
Cai Yixin Jeremy,"Reviewed in the United States on May 26, 2010",,5.0 out of 5 stars,The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo by Stieg Larsson,"This book is one of those hidden gems that no one really knows about until they start hearing about the hype. For the uneducated, this book represents the first in a series of posthumous works done by a Swedish man named Stieg Larsson, a former editor in chief of a Swedish anti-racist magazine, Expo. Died at the still-young age of fifty, he left a series of manuscripts behind and these have become a sort of a publishing phenomenon, gaining fans in as far as Asia and America and every continent in between. But this series has teeth, has grit like no other, and the international success is well deserved. A writer of political journalism who has such masterful storytelling in his repertoire, however direct and clunky, is a gift rarely seen.What we have here could be described as a typical thriller hook: the plot of the missing girl. A girl named Harriet Vanger has been missing for well over four decades, which turns out to be something of an unsolved mystery. That is the impetus for Henrik Vanger's obsession in solving the case of the missing niece. Along the way, he employs a character said to be the closest thing to a Stieg Larsson literary alter ego, Mikael Blomqvist, a journalist, who in turn finds out a devious secret within the Vanger family. But the true star of the book (and the series, for that matter) is the seemingly anti-social computer hacker, who turns out to be the one who actually falls in love, albeit in the only way that she knows. But not before she gets knee deep in the case herself.If there is one thing to be said about the gothic and rather rude Lisbeth Salander, it is that she contains some of Larsson's own traits, as mentioned by many of his biographers. Not surprising at all. One can only see how this series became an overnight publishing sensation. The character symbolizes a sort of enigma on which the other seemingly strange happenings (some of them could be deemed to be offensive) could have been pointing towards. A mystery in female form, and yet she feels familiar, friendly even. Larsson's choice of characters feels symbolic. Consistent with the rest of the book, every plot detail, however clumsy and coincidental, feels symbolic in the overall theme of domestic and psychopathic abuse. Which is why, I think, Harlan Corben coined it to be a novel of big ideas, which it certainly is. Larsson does cramp a lot of seemingly post-modern furnishings to the story as well, but frequent mentions of Apple's Powerbook seem an overtly expressed obsession on Larsson's part.However, that remains a small concern, as the story does have some scary moments in which status quos are changed in an instant. Coupled with issues as raw and shocking as serial murder and rape, this book does enthrall even hardcore thriller fans, partly because of its intense shock value, but more so the charming articulation of the shocking subject matter itself. The crimes seem impactful and meaningful in view of the overall plot and Larsson's worldview never feels compromised on top of it. Although he writes in a Jason Starr-esque style that emphasizes plot above beautiful reading prose, the plot here feels appropriate to the book's purposes, the compelling factor of it drawing us in, making us turn the pages at a staggering rate.To experience such a phenomenal piece of work in depth, you need to read it for yourself. This is because, frankly, mere words can never sufficiently detail every single nuance in this book. It would be impossible to do such a thing. Just know that when you come into this book, don't feel intimidated in the least. Instead, approach this thrilling crime story with open arms. The dividends are bountiful.",,
Kerra,"Reviewed in the United States on March 8, 2011",,5.0 out of 5 stars,The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo,"This novel was very much unexpectedly great. It was not just good, it was great. I do not normally read the book descriptions or the back of a book when I buy them. When you do that you have expectations of how you think a novel will be and when you read the description and it is not the way you thought it would be, it is kind of a let down. I also did not read the description on this book either, but seeing how everyone was raving about how good this book was I decided to read it. I don't know what kind of book I thought this would be, but it was exceedingly better than I thought it was going to be. The mystery in this novel was very captivating and held my interest so much so that I had a hard time putting this book down. It was a little boring in the beginning because it talked a lot about big time company businesses and how this journalist got in trouble for writting about them in a magazine. So, when I started this novel I said to myself ""people are loving THIS?"" However, after the first two chapters it got very interesting. I also was unsure if I wanted to read this story and get attached to it because the ending of the story is gone, but I can asure you that at least in the first book the story does not leave you hanging. I thought that you wouldn't find out the ending to any problem or mystery in this book because there was more to follow. I can not wait to read the next book!The only advice I can give to anyone about to purchase this book, is that this novel is based in Sweden and is a foreign novel. I know that many of you probably assumed that, but that would have been a nice little bit of information that I would have liked to know. It really doesn't matter that it was based in Sweden or that it is a foreign based novel because it was still great and had nothing to do with how good or not the novel is, but it was just unexpected. The other thing that I would have liked to know is that there is very strong sexual violence in this novel. Again this does not make the novel bad in my eyes, but for others that don't like reading novels with things like that in it, I would advise you not to read this novel. There are very few parts of sexual violence in this novel, but the few parts are hard to read. However, it does make you have even stronger emotions for this novel and the characters.Hope you love it as much as I did. Great read!The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo",,
Elizabeth,"Reviewed in the United States on July 25, 2009",One person found this helpful,5.0 out of 5 stars,A compelling mystery of a missing girl.,"The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo is the story of a mystery surrounding a missing girl named Harriet Vanger.  There are many characters in this book, some may even say there are too many, but every character is involved in one way or another with the forty year old mystery of what happened to Harriet Vanger.Each character in this novel has his or her own story.  First and foremost there is Mikael Blomkvist, a financial journalist who is sued for libel after writing a scandalous and damaging article about multi-billionaire Hans-Erik Wennerstrom. The novel begins with Mikael's conviction, which he meekly accepts. The details surrounding his involvement with Wennerstrom are revealed gradually throughout the novel. Mikeal is sentenced to 90 days in jail plus a hefty fine.Erika Berger is Mikael 's co-worker and romantic interest. Berger is married, but her husband allows her to see Mikael on the side. The arrangement works for everyone involved. She is forced to take over their magazine, Millennium, which Blomkvist and her head up together, when Mikael decides to resign after his conviction.Now onto to Harriet Vanger. Shortly after Mikael's day in court, he is contacted by an attorney who represents an elderly but well known industrialist named Henrik Vanger. The Vanger Corporation has an extensive history, but is in a steady decline.  Mikael wonders what someone like Henrik Vanger would want with a man who was very publicly convicted of libel. Almost forty years ago, Henrik's niece disappeared without a trace. Ever since then someone has been torturing Henrik and sending him a pressed flower on his birthday, something Harriet did the birthday before her disappearance.Henrik makes Mikael a deal: spend a year attempting to the solve the case of his missing niece and he will serve him Wennerstrom's head on a silver platter. Mikael doesn't know why, but he accepts the challenge and moves into the Vanger estate under the guise of writing a biography of the Vanger family. Henrik is very adamant that the search into Harriet's disappearance must remain discreet.Before Henrik Vanger contacts Mikael Blomkvist to investigate Harriet's disappearance, he has him investigated. Here is where the girl with the dragon tattoo enters the picture. Her name is Lisabeth Salander. She is considered mentally impaired and must regularly report to her guardian appointed by the court. Lisabeth has a troubled past with abuse and borders on the sociopathic, however, her skills as an investigator are legendary. She is hired  by Vanger to investigate Mikael and then is asked to drop the investigation.  Mikael and Lisabeth, however, join forces and try to solve the unsolveable mystery of what in the world happened to Harriet Vanger. Lisabeth is a strange girl. She described as almost child-like. Most people mistake her for an anti-social anorexic teenager, but Lisabeth is actually a dangerously brilliant hacker/investigator with a photographic memory.The Girl with Dragon Tattoo is an engaging mystery that will grab you and won't let you go until you discover the horrible secret behind Harriet's bizarre disappearance. The novel almost reminded me of an Agatha Christie mystery with its list of suspects and possible motives.  Almost everyone is a suspect in Harriet's disappearance. The ending might be considered a cop out to some readers, but this was still an incredibly intense novel. I was sad to hear about the author's passing, but so grateful that he left us a sequel to this fabulous novel.",,
J. Aaron Bellamy,"Reviewed in the United States on October 7, 2010",One person found this helpful,4.0 out of 5 stars,Fire breathing procedural,"What a great fun, albeit macabre, read `The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo' is. Don't be fooled by the hype machine that presents this novel to be anything more than it really is: a chilling procedural mystery yarn in the best traditions of the genre. Sure, it takes awhile to get going and some adjusting to the staccato and clumsy translation may take some pages to adjust to, but once complete, you'll whip through the 600 pages with eager ease.I won't describe the plot here, as so many reviewers do, often with spoilers. If you like mysteries, you'll enjoy this book, plain and simple. This isn't a literary book though, as some may mislead you into expecting. You could read this book on the beach, in a hot-tub, or pretty much anywhere on vacation. But this won't go on the bookshelf next to Catch 22 or Murakami or anything. On the other hand, one could probably successfully make a case for Lisbeth Salander as one of the more, if not most, unique of mystery novel protagonists. She has the unique distinction of being both the hero and a victim (in many ways) as well as a mostly unlikeable and extremely troubled mess of the best and worst humanity has to offer. The one star reviewers out there really should probably lighten up a little. If you think mystery novels are inherently bad and a waste of time, this one won't be any different. If you enjoy a fast read with a few different spins on the genre and don't mind reading names with a few extra consonants and locations that don't correspond with a current CSI tv show, you'll probably rate this as high or higher than the average guy/gal. I'll be reading the next one soon. Enjoy.",,
PT Cruiser,"Reviewed in the United States on August 15, 2010",,5.0 out of 5 stars,What more can be said about this gripping novel?,"This review is from: The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo (Millennium Trilogy) (Paperback)After reading so many positive reviews about this book and being attracted to it because it was written by a Swedish author, I decided to see for myself if it was all it was hyped up to be. It was. By the end of the second chapter I was hooked and read through the book in just a couple of days. I read this book on my Kindle and immediately downloaded Stieg Larsson's second book, The Girl Who Played with Fire (Vintage). The book had all the features that I like in a novel, good character development, twists and turns in the plot, and a character who is a computer hacker. (What can I say, I like characters who can get information through devious means.) Lisbeth Salander, the hacker, was my favorite character in the book because she was such a different and fascinating person who we only find out bits and pieces about at a time.After reading this book, I just had to see the movie. It was nice to see what the producers thought the characters would look like but there were so many details of the book that were missing that it was kind of disappointing. The one thing I did like about the movie was that it showed the country and scenes where the story was to have taken place. It's nice, while reading the second book, to have an idea of what the characters could look like.There is a huge cast of characters and at times it was difficult to keep them all straight. I found myself referring back to the family tree that was included at the beginning. The book also mentioned a lot of cities and towns that were unfamiliar to me and it was a little difficult to keep track of them all because they were Swedish names. Looking some of them up on Google Earth helped to put them in context. One word of warning: the story is violent in many parts and people who find graphic details of that type of thing objectionable or upsetting would probably not find this book easy to read.The writing was excellent and I was sorry to learn that Stieg Larsson died soon after signing a contract for this book and his two others.

lb136,"Reviewed in the United States on February 10, 2010",One person found this helpful,5.0 out of 5 stars,Twisted thriller,"In this exciting thriller from Sweden (warning! translation!) aging industrialist Henrik Vanger hires Mikael Blomkvist, a disgraced journalist who's been found guilty (yes guilty--it's a crime in Sweden apparently) of libeling another industrialist. Eventually Blomkvist brings in the tattooed, body-pierced young woman of the title, Elisabeth Salander, who has already been introduced to the reader, and in rather dramatic fashion. Blomkvist's job is ostensibly to write a family history, although actually it's to find out what has happened to Vanger's niece Harriet, who disappeared nearly 40 years before. It's a classic locked-room puzzle. She seems to have disappeared from an island at a time when access coming and going was blocked off because of a traffic accident, and she is presumed to have been murdered and her body somehow disposed of.Of course, they do solve the puzzle.But the destination doesn't matter, it's the journey during which the pair encounter people pleasant (seldom), unpleasant (often), and just plain nuts (a couple of times). It's exciting enough, and the ingenious ways in which the sociopathic heroine gets revenge is a kick. I enjoyed it, but the book is stuffed with pornoviolence that will put some readers off. Way off. And some readers, perhaps some of the same ones, will object to the amorality of it all.Salander is one of detective fiction's most fascinating crime fighter. She's an expert computer hacker with a photographic memory, but she's sociopathic, malevolent, almost impossible to get along with, and seems to have no sense of right and wrong. She trusts nobody, and seems to have but one rule: cross her and she'll get her revenge.Try it.Notes and asides: Throughout, the author tosses in statistics about the violence committed against women in his country. They are frightening.",VINE VOICE,

Robertson,"Reviewed in the United States on May 25, 2009",One person found this helpful,5.0 out of 5 stars,My new favorite mystery...,"For many years, my very favorite mystery has been Playing for the Ashes by Elizabeth George.  But after reading The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo by Stieg Larsson, I now have a new favorite.  This book is not just well written, but the plot will haunt you.Mikael Blomkvist is a Swedish journalist and part owner of the financial magazine, Millennium.  Down on his luck, he receives a very lucrative offer from the rich and aging industrialist, Henrik Vanger.  Vanger wants to hire Blomkvist for an entire year.  First, he wants Blomkvist to write a book about the Vanger family.  Henrik believes his relatives to be ""for the most part thieves, misers, bullies and incompetents.""  Henrik claims that ""this story will make Shakespeare's tragedies read like light family entertainment.""  But the real reason for hiring Blomkvist is that Henrik wants the writer to revisit the disappearance and probable murder of his niece, Harriet, 36 years ago.  Henrik has conducted his own amateur investigation over the years and ""Blomkvist wondered whether this was an unhealthy obsession or whether over the years, it had developed into an intellectual game.  What was clear was that the old patriarch had tackled the job with the systematic approach of an amateur archaeologist.""At first, Blomkvist believes there is nothing new to be discovered.  But little by little, new light is shed on old clues and a clearer picture emerges.  Blomkvist needs the services of a researcher/investigator, and so Lisbeth Salander is hired.  Salander (the girl with the dragon tattoo) is young, disturbed, anti-social, and perhaps suffers from Asperger's Syndrome.  But she is an incredibly talented investigator with a photographic memory and the ability to hack into computers.  The two make a good team.  The closer they get to unveiling the truth, the more their lives are at risk.  I carried this book around with me for several days until I was done--I just couldn't put it down.What makes this book even more fascinating are the circumstances surrounding the book and the author.  Stieg Larsson was a Swedish journalist who died in 2004 of a massive heart attack at the young age of 50.  He had three complete novels written but unpublished at the time of his death.  The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo is the first of what has become known as the Millennium Trilogy.  Originally written in Swedish and published in 2005, the English translation was released in 2008--winning a number of posthumous awards for Larsson.  The second book, The Girl Who Played with Fire reunites Blomkvist and Salander and will be released in the United States on July 28, 2009.  I have already ordered a copy!",VINE VOICE,
Roger Long,"Reviewed in the United States on May 6, 2010",,5.0 out of 5 stars,An unforgetable character,"The elements that make up a novel are Plot, Character, Atmosphere and Writing Style.  This book is excellent in the first three but, alas, sometimes lax in the last.The plot is intricate and very detailed.  A magazine editor is hired to find out what happened to an adolescent girl who disappeared decades ago.  He eventually is teamed with a very strange young woman researcher.  That sums it up, but the plot is far more involved.  The theme is male violence toward women, although it is some time before that becomes clear.The two major characters are the ""detectives"" in this quest, with the more interesting one being Lisbeth Salander, one of the great figures in all literature.  She's in her mid-twenties and looks like a biker with her spiked hair, various tatoos and piercings.  Her social skills are so close to nil that she has a government appointed keeper of sorts.  But she is a tireless researcher with a photographic mind.  And these contradictions are what make her come alive for the reader.  Too many fictional characters can be described in a word or two, but not Lisbeth.The atmosphere is excellent.  The primary setting is a small Swedish island with a bridge to the mainland.  Most of the residents are members of a large, wealthy, dysfunctional family that owns a multi-layered business enterprise.  The author takes the reader there and to the other locations that figure in the story.  The key to atmosphere in a novel is the feeling the reader has that he knows the place, can feel it, smell it, etc.With all this going for the novel, it is marred by the writing style, more specifically by the abundance of cliches.  Other reviewers have catalogued some of these, and I won't repeat them.  I'm assuming that cliches in Swedish are different from those in English, so the blame should probably rest upon the translator and ultimately the editor.  The cliches don't ruin the novel, but they may make a reader wince now and then.All in all, this is an excellent piece of work--not for those who want their novels on rails with characters that can be described in a word.  It's more akin to The Tin Drum, Shogun and Crime and Punishment than to pop bestsellers.",,
Italo Perazzoli,"Reviewed in the United States on April 16, 2011",,4.0 out of 5 stars,The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo,"According to Penny Laurie, Stieg Larsson, the author of this book, witnessed the rape of a girl, her name was Lisbeth (Girls tattoos and men who hate women, New Stateman, published in date 09-05-2010), i.e. the heroine of this mystery novel, for this reason, I can argue, that this is not a fiction but an intimate autobiography dedicated to Lisbeth where she lives in every single word of his trilogy.The major themes are a detailed description of the contemporary Swedish society, a radical capitalism without any sort of morality and also an unmentionable nostalgia for the Nazism.The round characters of this novel are Mikael Blomkvist a journalist and publisher of the Millennium Magazine and Lisbeth Salander, an intelligent hacker and researcher but antisocial.Initially Mikael Blomkvist, is described by the author, as an irresponsible journalist, because he was convicted of libel, writing a defamatory report against Hans - Erik Wennersrom, a famous (and corrupted) Swedish capitalist.Mikael is a rare contemporary journalist he is drove by an innate sense of morality and justice, his mission is writing reports and articles against any kind of financial corruptions.Lisbeth Salander is an antisocial gothic girl described as a retarded girl, mainly because she does not follow and respect the dogmas imposed by the local society, but then she will reveals of being extremely intelligent in her field.Unfortunately during her childhood and in the contemporary life she has been a continuous victim of perverted men, they have destroying irreparably her fragile personality causing in her soul a sort of duality which is characterized by the role of a victim and in the same time as a tremendous tormentor against her victims.Her personality become evident when she write on the skin of Nils the following phrase:""I am a sadistic pig, a pervert, and a rapist""As you can imagine the plot of this ""autobiography"" is extremely violent enveloped by a complex financial fraud a family's secret and violence of any kind, but nevertheless there is a small and imperceptible source of romanticism; it is the pressed flower.CheersItalo",,
John F. Rooney,"Reviewed in the United States on March 20, 2010",,5.0 out of 5 stars,The Tattoed Lady Clashes with the Serial Killer,"""The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo"" is part missing girl mystery, part financial shenanigans investigative journalism expose, part serial killer thriller, part computer geekery and hacker insider dope, and part exploration of the way a dysfunctional woman can function highly efficiently when focused. Take an absorbing, magnetic story and mix in a lot of intrigue with engrossing characters and you've got a 590 page novel that clips along without boring its readers. Mikael is an investigative financial reporter who is part owner of the magazine Millennium. He writes and prints an exegesis about the crooked dealings of a money titan named Wennerstrom. Unfortunately the titan sues him for libel, Mikael loses, and gets a ninety-day jail sentence and a fine. Fortunately he gets hired by eighty-two-year-old Henrik Vanger to write a family history but especially to look into the disappearance of his grandniece Harriet Vanger some forty years before. Henrik wants to know why the family murdered her and why they have been trying to drive him insane with a yearly gift of a single flower on his birthday. Lisbeth Salander, the fascinating title character, is a misfit, a loner, a hippie, an avenger, and a hacker who joins Blomkvist in an investigation that puts both of them in great physical danger. She wouldn't want you to feel sorry for her (she could care less what other people thimk of her), but you do develop an affinity for her.This is the third book the Millennium trilogy by the late Stieg Larsson who died at the age of fifty in 2004. Parts of the book are very suspenseful, melodramatic and action-packed, but it is the story itself, the author's way of telling you the story, and the pull of the characters that will hold your interest. The book has an excellent plot, well-narrated with vivid hypnotic characters. It gets more exciting as it rolls along and pulls you in. It's better when it's dealing with the machinations of the dysfunctional Vanger family on their own island, than it is when dealing with the Wennerstrom financial hoopla in the last section.It's a long slog but well worth it with graphic serial killer stuff in addition to the missing girl story. I don't think I'm ready for the other two books in the series yet but will read them eventually.",,
Alan A. Elsner,"Reviewed in the United States on March 19, 2009",2 people found this helpful,4.0 out of 5 stars,Gripping for much of the time but disappointing ending,"This book has become enormously popular and it's easy to see why. After a slow start in which the author introduces the main characters and sets the scene, we are plunged into a fascinating investigation of a crime, or possible crime, committed 40 years in the past. The heiress of a wealthy industrial dynasty in Sweden has disappeared. The old scion of the family hires an investigative reporter to make a final attempt to find out what happened to her. He in turn teams up with a young investigator, (the girl of the title) who possibly has Asperger's Syndrome -- at any rate, she does have a photographic memory and an unbelievable talent at computer hacking. Together, they peel back the onion layers, gradually revealing the terrible truth.Some observations: having lived in Sweden, I wondered how many foreign readers got references to previous Swedish financial scandals -- Ivar Kreuger the Match King -- and political crises -- the Palme assassination, the Ebbe Carlsson affair. There are references to the Wallenberg family, which controlled a large portion of the Swedish economy for many decades. It would also help to have a working knowledge of Astrid Lindgren, the beloved author of Swedish childrens books like ""Pippi Longstocking."" Perhaps it doesn't matter but it certainly helped me read the book knowing some of the places described and with a rough idea of Stockholm and Swedish geography.I was amused by the fact that the journalist, Carl Mikael Blomquist, is sentenced to three months in prison for libel. First, in the United States, libel is a civil, not criminal matter. I read on one website dealing with the First Amendment, the following:""Fewer than half of the states have criminal defamation statutes. Some of those laws, though still on the books, have been invalidated by court decision. Even in states where criminal libel laws exist, prosecution under those statutes is rare.""But the prison is like a holiday camp. Blomquist is allowed to keep his laptop and carry on with his work. He himself looks back on his prison term as a kind of stress-free rest period. That would never happen here.The ugly side of the Swedish nanny state is demonstrated by the treatment of Lisbeth Salandar, the youthful investigator, who is a ward of the court and remains under the control of a state-appointed guardian well after she becomes a legal adult. How is this possible? Only in a country which gives the state such power over the individual, on the grounds that it is ""for his or her own good.""That brings me to the next point: so many Swedish mysteries seem to have sick, perverted, violent, disgusting acts of sexual violence at their heart, and this is no exception. Does this reflect the traditional, uptight, repressed national character.?I think the depiction of one particular act and the victim's reaction to it is very unrealistic.I enjoyed this book but I found the last 50 pages a severe anticlimax so I'm only giving it four stars. But I acknowledge that Stieg Larsson knows how to tell a good story - definitely an above-average mystery/thriller.",VINE VOICE,
Clinton Enlow,"Reviewed in the United States on July 13, 2009",,4.0 out of 5 stars,The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo,"I always seem to have trouble articulating whether I liked something immediately after finishing it. I'll admit I picked up The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo after hearing about the unfortunate circumstances surrounding its publication that seem to grow towards mythic proportions (on one hand Stieg Larsson wrote it to amuse himself passing the time, on the other He had actually submitted the three manusripts in the trilogy before suffering his fatal heart attack). What can't be denied is that The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo is a slow burn thriller quietly plotted out with  political and societal subtexts to its story. It does also contain one of the more interesting characters in Lisbeth Salander, social misanthrope hacker whom people are interested in understanding even if doing so upsets their nature.The main thrust of the story concerns disgraced journalist Mikael Blomkvist who's hired by aged industrialist Henrik Vanger to write a chronicle of his twisted family that includes ties to Nazism and a thirty five year old mystery. In truth the old man wants Blomkvist to find out what happened to his beloved niece who disappeared at a family event some time prior which is marked with the arrival every year of framed flowers to the old mans house.I'll admit that the book is indeed very slow. Most of the first part of the book details Blomkvists problems after losing a case for libel in court and Salander having to deal with a perverted lawyer who's become her gaurdian in financial matters. The mystery doesn't really develop until further in the book as the twisted case of the Vanger family is related to Mikael from Henrik. Things do perk up when Blomkvist and Salander meet and become friends but I will admit that the mystery portion of the novel did seem built upon a revelation that only came about three hundred or so pages in and felt a little forced to drive the plot along.Still though I did enjoy the novel and its quiet pacing. I liked the characters especially the twisted Vanger family themselves. And I liked Larsson worked social issues primarily on violence directed towards women throughout his plot while figuring heavily with the conclusion.In the end its a great book with a fascinating mystery. I look forward to reading The Girl Who Played with Fire soon.",,
David Island,"Reviewed in the United States on September 24, 2009",,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Grisly, Modern, Off-Beat Quasi-Detective Romp Through Sweden","Because one of the two loosely interlinked stories in ""The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo"" is far more compelling than the other, the end of the book proves disappointing, since it was necessary for the more interesting story to be concluded first - a good 100 pages from the end of the book. Thus, keeping reader interest to the last page proves impossible for Steig Larsson, though he did his best by continuing to involve most of the key players in narrating the end to the less interesting second story. That is the main problem in this book: the thin almost non-existent connection between the two primary story lines, and the necessity of ending the book with the less interesting one.What link the two stories together are the main players, Blomkvist and Salander and some of their side-kicks and compatriots. Their actual link-up did not occur, however, for at least the first 300 pages as their separate life stories were developed without overlap. Thus, it was a very long lead-up to their collaboration.  Too long?  Yes. Way too long.Thus, we have the other great flaw in this novel: it is too long (590 pages). While the stories are often very good and engrossing (except for the incomprehensible Swedish geography detail), the book itself is, in my estimation, at least 100+ pages too long. The extra length was sheer fluff, existing on virtually every page and often several pages long - a clear case of ""too much information"" (TMI).At times there is a very good, exciting pace to the tale, especially, as an example, when the evil one decides to try to murder Blomkvist with a rifle.Quite a bit of the central story is grisly, almost hard core and brutal pornography - gruesomely difficult to read at times. But after all, the central message of the book revolves around abuse and murder of innocent women. Even the telling about past abuse done to others is awful, let alone the experiencing of it by Salander and -- one time only -- by Blomkvist. Incest, murder and torture become major themes in the book.""The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo"" is quite well written and for the most part interesting (except for the secondary story - a world-wide economic gangster scam -- which is, frankly rather dull). The translation, performed by 65 year-old Reg Keeland (who lives in Albuquerque, New Mexico), is admirable, though the pages are often peppered with long unused American slang phrases from the 1950s and 1960s, a function of his generation, no doubt and how he perhaps mistakenly believes Swedes talk casually to each other or write. All-in-all, though, it's a zippy translation and quite contemporary. He does an especially good job translating 24 year-old Salander's voice.Salander is by far the most interesting character in the book, completely and fully consistent from one end of the book to the other. She is maddening and funny, sexy and unappealing, smart and dumb all at the same time, but always (almost always anyway) fully on top of everything that occurs in her young life. She is a women's advocate, a champion for abused women everywhere, and with good reason. Her own life is filled with unhappiness, abuse, wrongful societal categorization, and alienation. She blossoms into a more complete woman in the company of Blomkvist, but in the end .... well ... in the end, there is an end, ordinary and sad as it is. The book is really all about Salander, her skill, the ultimate tragedy of her life and her disdain for all authority and societal norms. While she doesn't hate all men (particularly not Blomkvist), she does believe most males are idiots and a good percentage of us abusive and misogynist.Blomkvist is portrayed as the opposite of the male chauvinist pig. He does have his ""piggish"" qualities, but they are not founded in a dislike of women. On the contrary, he seems able to charm and seduce almost any woman he finds interesting, regardless of age, social status or background. In a sense, he is really a neutral kind of guy, smart and apparently attractive, and he rarely makes waves.  He's a dogged investigative journalist, who accepts his fate -- time and time again.  The problem with the Salander-Blomkvist relationship is that both are incapable of and uninterested in discussing their relationship. They are together because of mutual sleuthing skills and sex. As such, it can't end well, one might think.Blomkvist's other love interest, Erika Berger, is a flashy successful business woman, Blomkvist's full equal and business partner. She actually is not a very interesting character. The old man, Henrik Vanger, is well portrayed and ably characterized as the elder statesman of his huge and dysfunctional family.I liked the book and I would recommend it to most of my friends and acquaintances. I honestly don't know how to rate it. Is it a 3 or a 5?  I'll settle for a 4.0.",,
Dawn-Marie,"Reviewed in the United States on December 29, 2008",One person found this helpful,4.0 out of 5 stars,I can't wait for the sequel!,"The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo is one of the most purely enjoyable books I've read in a long time, and I am eagerly awaiting the release of the sequel (which I will probably buy as a UK import rather than wait an extra seven months). The story itself is captivating, and once it ramps up, you'll have a hard time putting the book down. That said, it does take a while for things to heat up -- you'll have to be patient through the first few dozen pages. More disappointingly, the heart of the story wraps up while there's still a lot of book left: there are a lot of loose ends that are wrapped up, while others are left on the table for Book 2. The end of the book is thus very anticlimactic (to put it mildly).I'd also like to say something about the values expressed in the book. There have been some complaints about the extreme violence contained herein, but as the original Swedish title for the book is Men Who Hate Women, that should be expected. The violence is in no way glorified. What is somewhat glorified (or at least not condemned) is the peculiar sexual mores of Scandinavia: the protagonist is having an ongoing affair with his partner/boss (who is married -- and her husband doesn't mind), while hopping off to have a ""regular lover"" in a 50-year-old woman, followed by a fling with a 25-year-old, etc. It appears that the author doesn't take these issues seriously, although the end of the book hints otherwise. Also, the author was a member of the Communist Party in Sweden, and once knowing this, some biases within the framework of the story are particularly clear. Then again, one of the ugliest aspects of the book, to me, was a throwaway pro-nationalism, anti-free trade remark toward the book's end, which doesn't particularly jive with internationalist communism. Regardless, neither the sexual values nor the political views of the author in any way detract from the superb story. I also feel like I got a bit of insight into Swedish culture, which was a bonus.",,
John Jenkins,"Reviewed in the United States on January 21, 2012",,4.0 out of 5 stars,Individual responsibility?,"Stieg Larsson should be commended for creating a wonderful plot and for bringing clarity and perspective to certain social issues.  But if we praise Mr. Larsson for calling attention to and condemning violence against women and intolerance, shouldn't we also scold him for celebrating unprotected sex and adultery?  I know that the one sexual incident in which contraceptives are defiantly disdained is the author's effort to show Lisbeth Salander making a role reversal statement; but, if Mr. Larsson is really trying to raise awareness of social issues, couldn't he have made this statement without reference to neglected contraceptives?This novel has strong themes of justice and revenge.  There are three villains, and Mr. Larsson works hard to give all of the villains what they deserve.  After the primary villain is identified, there is a strong dialogue between the two protagonists over whether the villain's upbringing was partially responsible for the crimes. One protagonist shows some sympathy and states that the villain was also a victim, but the other adamantly disagrees (and unfortunately the Rooney Mara/Daniel Craig movie version of the novel, which otherwise follows the plot more closely than the Swedish version, omits this dialogue).  In any case, this dialogue makes a good case for individual responsibility.  Revenge may or may not be good therapy, but people should be able to rise above injustices they may have experienced and not exploit the innocent or defenseless.",,
Brian Hawkinson,"Reviewed in the United States on April 17, 2011",,5.0 out of 5 stars,A definite recommend...,"I must say that I was pleasantly surprised with this the first novel in the series.  I'd had it recommended by two friends and knew nothing about it, but had to read just off of their recommendation.  I normally don't like mysteries, but this one certainly had me interested from the beginning.There were several contributing factors that made this novel stand out, made it something that easily draws the reader in.  The first is that I really didn't know who had done it.  You try and guess and then something new comes up and you change your mind until eventually I had no clue who the murderer was.  This is a huge plus in my book because it kept me interested.  I did have an inkling of a certain part of the plot and ending (don't want to spoil anything) but that, to me, was a side plot that actually enhanced the story and its appeal.The other major aspect that I liked was of course the character development with Lisbeth and Mikael.  Lisbeth, especially, did and said stuff that really enhanced her character's personality.  You are drawn in to like her despite her anti social view on life, her awkwardness, her blunt and sometimes rude personality.  Of course bad stuff happened to her in order for her to respond, but it none the less made her the most interesting character in the whole book (despite not really, comparatively, seeing as much of her as, say, Mikael).I eagerly read through the book and couldn't wait to pick it up again.  Not the best book I've ever read, but certainly one that I will remember and recommend to others.4.5 stars.",VINE VOICE,
"RMitra, mystery writer","Reviewed in the United States on November 19, 2008",One person found this helpful,5.0 out of 5 stars,A Twenty First Century Mystery Tour De Force,"If There Wasn't DeathAgatha Christie's The Mysterious Affair At Styles was published in 1920. She wrote the first great mystery tour de force in 1924. Every mystery fan remembers The Murder of Roger Ackroyd. Since then there have been a handful of books which stood out as outstandingly innovative while faithfully following the classic detective story rules. These are the books that leave the readers with a jolt in the solar plexus. Some do it with the climax, like Roger Ackroyd and in the 70s, Ira Levin's A Kiss Before Dying; some do it with a plot and writing that transcends the genre but staying within the rules, the unique, The Name of the Rose, by Umberto Eco.Now in 2008 comes Stieg Larsson (and he died before the books were published). Most of the reviewers, including the venerable Machiko Kakutani of the NY Times tend to give away the plot. I skipped the details so that when I reached about page 253, the blow to the pit of my stomach was as hard as a Muhammad Ali punch.It starts off inocuously enough. Mikael Blomkvist loses a case in court for journalistic zeal for his own publication. And we are introduced to the Girl With the Dragon Tattoo, Lisbeth Salander. Her horrible past is revealed later and the book goes forth on the sure footed prose of the writer, who without any over writing, maintains interest by plot creation and characters that are believable. No, Blomkvist is not a detective but he's piecing together a mystery that happened years ago, disappearance of young Harriet Vanger from a crowded party in a small island whose exit is cut off by an accident.A classic Golden Age plot, surely.Poirot had done it many times, delved into the past and came up with an answer.Blomkvist reluctantly takes the job that has baffled police and everyone else for forty years. How could anyone miss a clue after such thorough investigation? That is one of the major plotting factors that will delight any reader, particularly of the old school such as myself, who venerate the Christie,Sayers, Stout kind of writers.No more of the plot.The writing. Absolutely gorgeous without long metaphors or description of the weather. The interweaving of the characters is natural, convincing and at times produces envy. Who could have a girl friend married to someone else (happily) and would come to Blomkvist's bed when he's alone and not make any demands?The little village of Hedestad is like where Miss Marple might have lived. And the Vanger family . . . ay, tread carefully here, they have the secret . . .One wishes as the book speeds along that it was longer and the evening by the fireplace was prolonged.A highly satisfying, wonderfully literate, sophisiticated mystery that will have you squirming with delight.",,
Laurie Fletcher,"Reviewed in the United States on May 25, 2009",One person found this helpful,5.0 out of 5 stars,Well-executed first novel,"I love the unfolding sense of discovery that comes with a really well-written first novel.  And there's the growing apprehension that I may be reading a one-off and that all of the writer's energy and talent went into that one book, never to be repeated. But it is a fairly unique experience to read a book and understand that this was the first of three and there will never be any more. Whether or not Larsson pulled off in his second effort the wonder that is this book will have to wait until later this year when ""The Girl Who Played With Fire"" is released. My bets are on a quality repeat, especially since the star of his second book is the Asperser's-driven, 24-year-old computer genius we first meet in ""The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo"".  In fact, our troubled whiz-kid hacker, Lisbeth Salander, IS the girl with the dragon tattoo.This story isn't really hers.  It mostly belongs to Mikael Blomkvist, a journalist and publisher who has just had one of the worst years of his life. He has been set up, then successfully sued for libel, and now must face financial and professional ruin, as well as a prison sentence. Enter an aging industrialist with a problematic family who, for reasons unfathomable to Blomkvist, wants him to find out the true story behind the murder of his niece - decades before.Lisbeth's story is gently intertwined with the action until the two stories join and move forward with force. A word of warning - there is much necessary expose at the start of the book and the going is a little slow. It is worth the effort to track the characters and their environments. And, unless you are quite savvy in the world of international banking, business, and financial journalism, this is a great précis.I liked the story, loved the characters, and was sorry to see it end.  Ultimately, that's the best a reviewer can say. And I'm happily awaiting the release of the next two in this incredibly finite series.",,
JuLee Rudolf,"Reviewed in the United States on March 28, 2010",,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Tiny, tattooed gal is terrifically tough...smart, daring, and has the right stuff.","Pierced, tattooed, twenty-four-year-old, Lilliputian-sized Lisbeth Salander is, according to her boss, (p 30) ""beyond doubt the most able investigator he ha[s] met in all his years in the business."" She is also innately vengeful, mistrustive, and, from a reader's standpoint, an unlikely though extremely likeable heroine. And this book featuring her as its title has a lot going for it. The plot is convolutedly difficult to sort out and the story is filled with Swedish societal norms that are, in many ways, significantly different than their American counterparts. The development of the many characters contained in the story is excellent and their personalities range from charismatic to corrupt to utterly despicable.The story, set in Sweden in late 2002 through most of the following year, is this: a wealthy, elderly man named Henrik Vanger receives a rare, framed flower, as he has every year for the past 36, ever since the disappearance of his beloved 16-year-old niece, Harriet. Mr. Vanger soon hires a forty-two-year-old journalist (who's recently been sentenced to jail time for libel and defamation for an article he wrote) named Mikael Blomkvist to investigate the case under the guise of chronicling the Vanger family history. Helping with the case is Lisbeth Salander, the girl with the dragon tattoo, who is force to deal with dirty rotten scoundrels in both her personal and professional life. Although there are some marginally hokey moments (involving certain clues figured out in Chapter 16), some seriously sickening sex scenes, and an above-American-average level of promiscuity, the Girl, Ms. Salander, steals the ""show"" with her mad sleuthing skills and danger-defying daring.

A.S.,"Reviewed in the United States on July 22, 2010",One person found this helpful,4.0 out of 5 stars,Couldn't put it down (minor spoilers),"I just want to say, to everyone I've seen who has criticized this book for being too violent or the character being too shallow, I say I think you are wrong. The fact is, violence against women is a lot more common than it is made out to be. And people in power often take advantage of women. So I believe if you think this is too violent,than you aren't really accepting reality. The violence that takes place in the book is not that shocking when you consider the kind of events that often take place in today's society all over the world. And I thought it was appropriate for the story and sent a powerful message.Also, yes, some of the characters ARE shallow and morally ambiguous, but so what??? That's one of the best things about this book, it's honest. Many people ARE shallow and morally ambiguous. Again, to deny this is to deny reality and want a sugar coated description of characters that are not realistic. Most, if not all, people are NOT completely moral. Most people are capable of both good and evil. This book explores this theme, along with how power and corruption often go hand in hand. I loved the book. I will admit about the first 40 pages ARE kind of boring because it delves into the background story of the main male character, but after that it picks up right away and becomes a book you really can't put down.I, for one, like it when a book doesn't shy away from disturbing topics, and goes for something a little darker and unconventional.

Steven M. Anthony,"Reviewed in the United States on July 2, 2010",One person found this helpful,4.0 out of 5 stars,Good Murder Mystery/Suspense Novel,"I have never been a devotee of the ""murder mystery"" genre, though have read a few over the years and enjoyed a number of them.  This novel, written by Swedish author Stieg Larsson, is certainly a world wide sensation and acts as the first book of a trilogy by the recently deceased writer.The novel centers largely upon two individuals, a disgraced investigative journalist, Mikael Blomkvist and a freelance private investigator, Lisbeth Salander (the girl with the dragon tattoo).  Blomkvist is hired by an aged, wealthy industrialist, Henrik Vanger, to solve a 40 year old murder mystery involving his completely dysfunctional family.  We meet Salander prior to her involvement in the case, which she subsequently joins as Blomkvist's research assistant.This novel was originally written in Swedish and contains numerous references to Swedish names, places, customs and cultural idiosyncrasies.  As such, it can be slightly disconcerting and/or confusing to a foreign audience.  The themes of sexual assault, spousal abuse and other forms of violence to women are the primary focus of the novel.As a murder mystery, this novel is certainly entertaining.  The thread involving Salander, I found to be highly captivating and even educational.  Not being a huge fan of the genre, it is difficult for me to give a considered opinion upon this book's merit, however the payoff and subsequent dénouement were well conceived and presented.  Despite the fact that I will not likely proceed to the second book in the series, I suspect that fans of murder mysteries/suspense novels will gobble up all three.",,Top Contributor: Fantasy Books
D. Freeman,"Reviewed in the United States on March 6, 2010",One person found this helpful,5.0 out of 5 stars,Mystery set within mystery.,"As said before the synopsis has been reviewed on enough here, I will just write about my personal impressions.  As well as a couple of counter arguments that were mentioned the in negative critical reviews.Our girl with the dragon tattoo is anything but a one dimensional character.  She is very complex with her own demons driving her.  She has as extreme anti-social personality disorder with tendencies bordering on psychopathy.  But with some very important personal traits that exclude her from being a true sociopath.  She does have empathy towards others like her that have been abused or misused as well as a driven need for vengeance towards those that have forsaken the trust that may have been invested in them.  But she does have a learned (as opposed to a inherently ingrained) sense of what is right and wrong.  She is NOT a peripheral character.  The novel goes back and forth between her perspective and that of an investagative reporter that she finally hooks up with about half way into the book.  Even thought the book spends more time with him in that first half, it is her portions, though, that really grab your attention.  When I finished the book, I had a hard time starting my next one as I kept thinking back to ""The Girl"" and hoping the best for her. I will be reading the other two books in this series.As far as being a slow read, maybe a little in the beginning, but this is not some mindless Dan Brownesque page turner though.  It is a well thought out story with some really involving characterizations, you will know these people and have a good chance (if you are paying attention) to come up with some good ideas as to the solution.  There is also a totally essential genealogy chart at the beginning of the book to help you keep track of the players.  You will be referring to it often so you might as well bookmark it.I enjoyed this book beyond just a temporarily entertainment.  I will be thinking about it for some time.===Don Freeman[...]",,
Bruce Stern,"Reviewed in the United States on February 19, 2009",,5.0 out of 5 stars,The components of a top notch story,"What makes a great story? I'm not sure. But upon finishing this story I felt a satisfaction, a breadth and depth of feeling for the characters, especially the male and female protagonists, that rarely occurs, especially in a story that could mistakenly be called mystery.At its heart, 'The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo' is a tale of abused women by disturbed and hateful men. It's also about a particular woman with a mysterious past struggling to get on in a world which mostly barely tolerates her, tries little to understand her, and cruelly abuses her (by someone she should be able to trust). Lisbeth Salander also struggles with the painful chore of developing a moral compass and grounding, with little help from others, apparently including her family. She apparently has some sort of mental disorder which denies her the satisfactions of socialization. She's a savant, which enables her to find work of a specialized nature, and, importantly, allows her do it largely alone.Mikael Blomkvist, a magazine publisher, convicted of libel, gets manipulated into working for an aged and retired industrialist on a 40-year-old mystery. He struggles with his loss of reputation--his integrity meaning a great deal to him--resulting from the libel conviction. During his investigation he struggles with what 'means' is it okay to pursue to achieve the desired 'end.' He's a bit naive, and a genuinely good-hearted fellow, who finds himself mixed up with people who deliberately take advantage of him, but his don't-take-it-personally attitude repeatedly enables him to keep his eyes on the tasks, including impending jail time, that ultimately demand his focus.On many levels, this is as finely a written story, with fully developed characters, originality, and suspense, that one could hope for.Being a somewhat slow reader, that I was captivated so as to read the last 250 pages of this story in a day testifies to the enthralling part one of Mr. Larsson's trilogy.",,

Are they great literature? No. Are they rollicking page-turners? Yes, but with much more intricate plotting and more interesting characters than most. Sadly, all of the movie adaptations to date (all three Swedish films and the one English version with Daniel Craig) fail their source material. They all lack the detailed density of the books and are absent enormous sections of plot. And while both Book 1 (""Dragon Tatto"") movies have been well received critically and at the box office, I honestly can't undertand how anyone who hadn't read the books would like the movies. They seem so comparatively hollow. Read the books, and hope that the next Daniel Craig installment does a better job at adaptation. One word of caution, however, regarding the books: since all the characters' names are Swedish, you're likely to find yourself having a hard time remembering who's who, at least at first.

The storyline is oblique - the ""Girl with the Dragon Tattoo"" creeps into the story by bits and pieces - she is in many ways, not really the protagonist, although she plays a crucial role in the story, and is a fascinating character.  The cast of other characters - Mikael Blomkvust, Lisabeth Salander, Erika Berger, Henrik Vanger - are each drawn with masterful detail. The number of intertwining plots - the murder mystery, the conviction of Blomkvist for libel, the sordid skeletons in the closet of the Vanger family - all kept me in rapt attention.  The red herrings tended to be a bit blatant, but the endings to each of the plots were suprising and tidily pieced together.  That Larsson was an investigative journalist before he began writing fiction is hardly suprising.There has been much buzz and attention drawn around Larsson (and his untimely death) and the series he has written; I had been skeptical of the merits of the books as a result.  However, I was very pleasantly suprised.  While the story takes a round-about way of getting the first act started (and laying the foundation for the plot), the payoff is worth the wait.

For whatever reason lately it just seems like I've been reading books that aren't fun or exciting.  Maybe it's because I'm someone who loves the detail, mystery, intrigue, suspense and that ever elusive page-turning novel.  It's definitely hard to come by in my book (pun intended) but something I strive for each time I pick up something new.For me, this book, The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo was everything I look for in a novel.  I enjoyed the level of detail, from the Vanger family (although I will say some of it, especially the names, can be overwhelming at times), to the plot twists and depth of characters.  Some of the foreshadowing was delightful and when you think you saw it coming (sometimes you can guess), another brick will hit you from the opposite direction and take you down a different path.In the end though and despite the multiple threads so wonderfully woven together, everything comes together in a very nice, neat little package.  But don't let this seemingly simplicity fool you, this book is a fun, engaging and exciting read - I couldn't put it down.  I really wonder what kind of research Larsson did for this writing because he doesn't spare the smallest (but relevant) of details.A while ago I had actually thought about purchasing the book (for my Kindle of course) but read a couple of reviews and decided against it.  I'm really not sure why I made that decision, so I had been sitting on the fence for awhile.  I later learned that a number of my family members including my wife had read the book and also loved it, so I jumped off the fence and bought the book.  And I'm truly glad that I did.I guess I don't really need to say anything else - there are a bunch of reviews which already explain the characters, their motives, the locale and the plot(s) twists.  So I guess my review is for those of you that are sitting on the same fence and just need that extra little nudge, believe me, you will be glad you decided to take that leap.Enjoy the book...and I'm just now starting on Larsson's second (The Girl Who Played With Fire) and have pre-ordered his third, which is due out in May.I just love it when I'm delightfully surprised - I think you will be too.",,

Right around 13%, the story - or, more accurately, the characters - grabbed me.The cast of thousands was initially confusing until I realized that 80% of them didn't advance the story at all so they could be easily ignored. That simplified things a bit. And while I spotted a number of Kindle formatting/spelling errors, it wasn't so distracting as to ruin the pace of the story. I'm guessing much of the plodding prose should be credited more to the translator than the original author. But since I don't speak Swedish, I'll likely never know for sure.So while the book may have had a few issues - including the torturously slow start - the intertwining plots, weird characters and surprising twists kept me reading.

I read long novels the way I eat beef stew, making it last, enjoying all the different flavors and hominess of it. I read chick lit like it's a sorbet, sweet and light, and just right for the moment.So, when I picked up The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo by Stieg Larsson, I was expecting a quick mystery read. I ordered it on a whim, when I saw that Stephen King had highly recommended it. Hey, if Uncle Stevie recommends it, I'm game.At first, I was concerned, it opened up with Mikael Blomkvist on trial for libel. This was a concern on several levels. One, Mikael Blomkvist. I don't do well with translated novels. My brain spends too much time trying to get used to the unusual names to focus on the story. And two, trials for libel are not my kind of mystery. Every once in awhile, I'll get into a courtroom drama, but they're not my favorite. Luckily, I kept reading. Because after a few short pages of trial talk, it started to get better, and better, and better.As it says on the back of the book, this story combines murder mystery, family saga, love story, and financial intrigue into a complex and atmospheric novel.It's a mystery that reads like a favorite dramatic novel. I highly recommend this book.  This is book one of a trilogy, and I plan on reading the whole series. Unfortunately, with Stieg Larsson's recent death, there will be no more new books.",,

The fact that Harriet Vanger was alive all along was quite predictable from the start.

From my age, he died WAY too young, and selfishly, we'll not have any more of this series.  After reading this first one, I immediately downloaded the next two.His style is clear and crisp with enough suitable metaphors and digressions that advance ones sense of who or what.  As long as the book is, there is hardly a word wasted.  Don't read Swedish so no idea as to how closely the translation follows the original, but appears to be a very readable rendering.At the heart of it are the characters, and Larson does an outstanding job of sketching rich portraits in the fewest possible lines.  Salander and Blomqvist not easy to like - they both have some rough edges - but each is notable for his or her passion.Finished this first one and now long to get on with learning more about each of these characters.  As to the setting, while not devoid of Swedish culture, one need not be Swedish to feel comfortable with the references and holidays and laws and such.Overall, by all means, read this book.",,

ScrabbleMaven,"Reviewed in the United States on June 9, 2009",,5.0 out of 5 stars,Excellent Novel,"I bought this book on the recommendation of a friend.  It sat in my home for two weeks before I picked it up and started reading.  Once I did that, there was no turning back.It is a long book and an intricate story with a lot of characters.  It is to the author's credit that I was able to keep everyone straight with little trouble.  One other author that I know that has the ability to do this consistently is Stephen King.  Myriad characters; no confusion in the reader's mind.  And no confusion in the novel keeping the numerous 'facts' straight.  There was one minor error I saw concerning a birth date.  Beyond that, the editing was as good as the author.This is not the only thing that King and Larrson have in common.  There is also the ability to make what should be a long-winded novel totally captivating.  Every paragraph had a purpose.Like most people reading thrillers and mysteries, I work hard to figure out the clues before the ending.  I am pretty good at it too.  Mr. Larsson managed to do what ""Primal Fear"" once did.  The villain was a surprise.  The villain's backstory was a surprise.  There was one element I guessed but to state it here would be a spoiler.  And frankly I think that that one element was skilfully executed misdirection by the author keeping the real core mystery hidden from the reader.  Clever.I recommend this book to anyone who has an appreciation for a well-written novel with the ability to get the grey cells ticking over.  I am about to begin The Girl Who Played With Fire.  I expect the same satisfaction.",,

T. Good,"Reviewed in the United States on July 10, 2010",,4.0 out of 5 stars,Worthwhile reading,"I enjoyed this book and I recommend it. It does contain graphic violence and sexual encounters, so it is not for the immature reader. It is set in Sweden, therefore you do get a lot of Swedish names and places which I have to admit made me snicker every once in a while when a long string of names and places came rolling across the page in one sentence. Nothing like getting directions on how you get from A to B in Sweden. As I am not versed in the original language version, I have no idea how accurately it has been translated but I do not expect it is wildly off-base. It takes time to get rolling and the author was not the master of ""Just One More Chapter Before I Stop For The Night"", but I never felt the desire to give up on it. I think you will find it worth the time and you will want to continue through the rest of the series.The question you have to ask is if it is worth spending the money to buy a copy. I invested in hardcover copies which I found here at Amazon for what I felt was a fair price. I intend to keep my copies since I enjoyed the series, I will probably go back and read them again in the future.I have also just purchased the film made in Sweden and have watched it. I will post a review for it, but I will say here that the Noomi Rapace who plays Lisbeth Salander is so spot on in her portrayal, it is like she walked right out of the book.Enjoy!",,

I got into bed last night at a healthy 10:00pm and decided to read a few pages of Girl With a Dragon Tattoo before shutting off the lights.  At 1:45am I was still awake and had read 175 pages without even realizing it.This book starts out with three equally compelling narratives: 1.An eccentric and highly disturbed PI is given an assignment to investigate a recently maligned financial journalist, 2. Said financial journalist is likewise given an assignment to research the history/mystery surrounding the disappearance of a young female member of a prominent Swedish family 40+ years ago, and 3. Said prominent Swedish family turns out to have an exceedingly dark and twisted past.For about the first 200 pages the story moves along a fantastic clip; each of the many characters really take shape, and histories and back stories are well laid out.  After the 200 page mark, the story becomes an addiction.  More than once I found myself to have knots in my stomach and goose bumps on my arms, I was extremely irritated to have silly interruptions such as WORK, and my sleeping patterns were quite disrupted as I previously discussed above.Unbelievable book; 100% recommended.Rating: 5+ out of 5 starsSuggested With: Unemployment",,
Born2Late65,"Reviewed in the United States on October 10, 2010",,5.0 out of 5 stars,Only one major plot flaw.,"SPOILER ALERT___SPOILER ALERT.Hi,I'm very impressed w/this book. This was Larsson's first book. I know he was an editor, but this is different. I only found two things that I deem to be errors: one big, the other very minor. The small error was when Salander grabbed Martin's Glock, & flicked the safety on. One of the beauties of a Glock. Is that they don't have a traditional safety. There isn't anything to flick. The little lever in the trigger is the only safety. A little surprising given Sweden's proximity to Austria. I guess the author wasn't a gunny. It had no impact on the story line. The other error was much more substantive, though. Old man Vanger used to own/operate a newspaper. He would have known that staff photographers shoot many rolls a day. He would have known to check the newspaper's archives for the additional photos. It certainly would have dawned on him @some point during the almost forty years he spent investigating it. If not for a fresh lead? He would have done it for sentimental value. Those were the last pix taken of Harriett. Morrell was also quite competent. He too would have at least asked if other pix existed. That's a major plot flaw, IMO. Other than that, though. This was an excellent job of Larsson. The fact that it was his first book only adds to the achievement. It is a very enjoyable story to read.",,
D. Travis North,"Reviewed in the United States on March 10, 2011",One person found this helpful,2.0 out of 5 stars,Lost in Translation?,"I'd like to preface my views with a simple fact:  This book was translated into English.  It is possible that a lot of what I feel about this book can simply be attributed to being lost in translation.  That said...I feel that Larsson's writing style is matter-of-fact, and not in a good way.  It entirely lacks emotion, during scenes where emotions are absolutely necessary.  There are several suspenseful parts that are entirely lost because of this matter-of-fact style of writing.  Granted, it's hard to truly explain stressful situations in third-person, but it doesn't seem like much effort was given to that regard.As for the characters...I find that I didn't like a single one of them.  For that matter, I didn't connect with any of them either - except for the elder industrialist, and he wasn't even a prominent character.  This means that I didn't find myself caring about their emotional distresses, nor did I care what happened to any of them.  I also found the main character's relationships to be rather shallow and insensitive, despite the many descriptions of him being a ""good guy"" in the eyes of the other characters.There are two more books in the set, but I believe that this will be a good stopping point for me.  I will not be reading more of Larsson's work.",,
Matthew Arnold,"Reviewed in the United States on November 22, 2009",,5.0 out of 5 stars,fascinating,"My initial impression of this book was that it read like a long lost John Irving manuscript.  The depth and richness in the development of the Vanger family, Mikael Blomkvist, and Lisbeth Salander reminded me much of his style.  Salander, The girl with the dragon tattoo, is hands-down the hippest, edgiest, and simply coolest female character ever created by an author.  She trumps even Robbins' Sissy Handshaw in Cowgirls.  Salander is a side character who eventually enters into the primary story thread around the middle of the book.  So, don't be confused that the title character does not appear much until the middle of the book.  She's not the title character in the original Swedish edition which is called ""Men Who Hate Women"".The novel has several different stories masterfully layered together; each by itself would make for a solid novel and taken together they form a masterpiece.  There are very dark and disturbing themes, that is for sure.  And the book is a heady cerebral read, not for those craving an action packed quickly read story.  I did become so engaged in the story that I could not put it down and read the last 200 pages in one day.  It is difficult to describe the story without including spoilers; suffice it to repeat what is included on the back cover:  ""...murder mystery, family saga, love story, and financial intrigue...a complex and atmospheric novel.""",,

But let's not get carried away, it is what it is, a good story fairly well written, and that's all.The biggest disappointment for me is the main characters of Mikael and Salander. By the end of the book I was left with the feeling that they are particularly two dimensional and fairly bland. I didn't care for them one way or another. Perhaps something got lost in translation.As to some of the objections I have seen to some of the graphic content, I have to say I didn't find it that graphic at all. If it's part of the story and explains more about a character then I have no problem with some of the themes that Larrson included in this book, I didn't find it gratuitous or even particularly graphic.I'm certain the following two books of the series will be just as interesting and nothing short of a really good read, my hope is that Larrson spent a little more time rounding out his characters and making them a bit more likable and interesting.",,

This is the first of a trilogy that is very popular and getting amazing reviews at the moment. I am sorry, but I wasn't thrilled.  The first 3/4 of the book were almost painful. It was difficult to get through and even disgustingly graphic and desciptive with murder and rape.  Not a happy breezy read. It's actually difficult to find an actual review that tells you what the story is about, which is understandable since the plot is so complicated and involved.  It is a murder mystery on crack.  It reminded me of John Grisham a lot.There are a crazy amount of characters that are all tied into this journalist, big time corporation, rich family, corruption and missing persons case. All the people end up connected and intertwined and the bad guys turn out to be worse than humanly imaginable.The author Steig Larsson did however do a good job at hiding the ending and developing very unique and quirky characters. The last 1/4 of the book was good and supposingly the series gets significantly better, so I may come back to the other two at the end of the summer to see what happens to the characters who I enjoy a whole lot better than the plot.

C. Hylton,"Reviewed in the United States on March 5, 2012",,4.0 out of 5 stars,Larsson gives a voice to victims,"This book starts out with a meticulously slow plot. When the story finally plays out though, the story is well worth the time invested in reading it. I found Salender to be an almost heroic voice for real victims of violence,  or sexual abuse. One should not judge another based solely on social awkwardness. Besides the idea that the nonconformists of society are pigeonholed in some cultures, it gives one reasons to not opt for prejudicial attitudes when assessing another's intelligence.I found the author's viewpoint on the way social misfits are misjudged to be not only refreshing, but also accurate. Victims of these types of abuse have a variety of defence mechanisms and are often miscategorized in relation to their level of mental accuity. This character could demonstrate the real possibility that although a person may be socially inept, that peers nor officials should deem them to be unworthy of respect.Well done Mr. Larsson! As an adult survivor of abuse, I thank you for giving others a reason to pause before labeling me unintelligent simply based on my social graces (or lack thereof).",,

This is actually a pretty hard book to rate because having read the book for myself, I can safely say that both sides have a point. The book can be quite difficult to get into at first with all its' talk about corruption within Sweden's financial institutions and the like, and the book could certainly have used a broader stroke with the editing pen (perhaps Swedish doesn't translate into English well?) I was prepared through about a hundred pages or so to rate this book negatively because of its' barely trotting start, but then something happened around page 150 as this story of family intrigue and personal redemption began to take shape and it just never let up on me. I blitzed through from page 294 to the end in ten hours...I couldn't put the thing down because of all the plot twists and character development that really leads one to wonder who's the good guy and who's the bad guy. No character in Larsson's world comes off as black and white good or bad, rather the characters are marked with faults some irrevocably so.

As a mystery author, I was particularly enamored with his restraint in using tension and violence sparingly. All too often authors ratchet up the tension to such a degree that the story loses its ability to shock and surprise.In this book of over 600 pages you can count on one hand the number of scenes where the protagonist, Michael Blomqvist, was in imminent danger. The same holds true for the girl with the dragon tattoo, Lisbeth Salander. Yet the novel is accurately described as mesmerizing, refreshing, and a dark-hearted thriller, by three major reviewers on the back cover.Larsson pairs a journalist and a security investigator, who works almost exclusively on a computer, to uncover a 40-year-old mystery. Instead of writing to the lowest common denominator, Larsson unveils a large cast of complex characters with engaging histories. The fact that this novel earned tremendous popularity is a testament to fiction readers' desire to cast aside the cookie cutter in favor of a truly unique perspective.RJ McDonnellRock & Roll Rip-Off2010 Mystery/Thriller Novel of the Year - Premier Book Awards[...].",,

This book is well written and very detailed; Larsson goes into fine detail about every character and even some background on the situations that the characters are in.  I especially enjoyed seeing Lisbeth's character develop.This novel is Swedish, so there are tons of places and names in here that I don't know how to pronounce.  Most of the time when the author named a place I'd just skip over it and read on.

Then I picked up the book everyone was talking about. The beginning was quite difficult. I didn't really care about the characters and I was somewhat confused by what was going on, considering Larsson's great detail in explaining Swedish government, laws and politicians at some points, which I know absolutely nothing about. But once Blomkvist is invited to visit Mr. Vagner, the real story begins and the book really takes off. The plot develops in such a way, with small, strange things popping up that keep the reader's interest peaked. Every time one question is answered, several new ones emerge.

I love that many of the females (besides the lead) are strong and powerful in their own way. However, I think the book could have been written better. It gets too wordy at times with too many details that I don't find of interest. Yes, I love having an image in my head of a scene, but sometimes Stieg Larsson's descriptions end up boring me instead of fascinating me. He also puts in many details about government and politics, but that part is understandable. The trilogy is thrilling and action-packed, but it is also a portrayal of corruption and how secrets in government end up harming the citizens the government is supposed to protect.Lisbeth is an amazing character and I guess part of the reason I like her so much is that it's unlikely there's any real person like her out in the world. It's rare that a main character who is so antisocial, socially awkward, and so distant is so likable. You end up cheering her on and supporting her acts of violence because all her life, she has been mistreated and misunderstood. You want her to get her justice. And of course, she gets it done Lisbeth Salander-style. You can't trust the government to properly deliver justice in this case because the leaders in government don't even fully know what's going on.All in all, this is a great trilogy that combines action, crazy characters, and politics.

I must admit I found it a bit disappointing. It's not a bad story exactly, but the structure, pacing, and character development left much to be desired. There are many long, tedious descriptive passages dealing with the financial dealings of Swedish corporations and the complete geneology of one family. Some of this is essential to the plot, but the rest seems like padding and seriously affects the pacing of the story. In its paperback form, this book is nearly 600 pages long. I felt the story could have easily been told in 300. There is also a problem with character development. The main character, Mikael Blomkvist, is described as a ""charismatic womanizer,"" but the way he is written, he seems lumpy, unlikeable, and completely devoid of charisma. The titular character is interesting, but as another reviewer pointed out, she is little more than a sidekick in the book. Needless to say, I will not be reading the sequels.",,
electron,"Reviewed in the United States on April 9, 2011",,3.0 out of 5 stars,Saved by a Belle,"Plain and simple, without Lisbeth Salander, this book would be on the bottom shelf next to the $.99 value DVD bin at Wal-Mart.  The writing is sloppy, sensationalist and the story largely predictable.  Even Lisbeth Salander, an abused badass hacker, bike riding, 88 pound ass-kicking badass is the product of massive male fantasy.  One gets the feeling Larsson stole the heroine from Peter Høeg's Smilla's Sense of Snow and then punked her out. The prose too is boring as the English translation lacks any sort of idiom in the language.  I would have to read the original Swedish to know if it digests the same in Larson's native language.  The other two books are largely weaker, slower and lack the social framework this one does.There is a solid topic at work here as phrased in the actual title of ""Men hate Women,"" but this isn't that deep.  Salander is an amazing main character, but the story too is forgettable.  I would say the movie adaptation is surprisingly much more entertaining.  If you've never read a mystery before, this should just blow you away.  But if you've been through Agatha Christie's library, it's weaksauce.",,
Rexford,"Reviewed in the United States on February 2, 2011",,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Intelligent, engrossing, suspenseful","Although I had listened to both subsequent audiobooks in this series and had seen the Swedish motion picture of Dragon Tattoo, I couldn't wait to plunge into this.  There is so much more in the way of detail and subplots in this unabridged audiobook that the movie was just a sketchy prelude.  Knowing how everything turned out in this trilogy seemed to dimish the excitement not a whit.  A special note regarding the narrator, Simon Vance: the perfect choice for these books and an incredible voice actor.  Listening to audiobooks like this one has made me wary of any motion picture based on a novel.  It is not that the Swedish motion pictures are bad--in fact, they are very well done--but they have to rush through the complexities of character development and plot in such a cursory manner that I would not know what was really happening were I not recently exposed to the unabridged version.  Even if you've seen the movies, get these audiobooks if you really want to enjoy this series.  Also, I had noticed that this audiobook actually has two editions with apparently identical packaging, one with a different narrator (who I haven't heard).",,
M. Molenda,"Reviewed in the United States on June 23, 2009",One person found this helpful,4.0 out of 5 stars,Definately stands out,"This book is perfect for fans of mysteries with detailed and intertwined subplots.  It is centered around several characters challenging each other  and competing as the upstaged protagonist; all are quite interesting and different (each slightly tending toward one evil or good dimension when all is said and done).The two leads are a famous Swedish journalist, a righteous Mikael Blomkvist stunted by a questionable libel conviction, and a waif gothic hacker, the ingenious and strange Lisbeth Salander, who inspires the title.  They ultimately come together as an old unsolved, high profile mystery surrounding the disappearance of a young female member of a wealthy industrialist family begins to unravel.  Warning, this novel does have a generally liberal and sometimes disturbing sexual orientation at times, and is not really appropriate for adolescents.This novel is paced deliberately slow, though it really does grab you and introduces the subplots methodically and convincingly over the first hundred or so pages.  A few of the conclusions were lame, but most were worth the time invested and some were inspirational.  The writing style is quite good, though somewhat short of literary - much, much better than the average mystery writer.  On a final note, don't worry about the Swedish to English translation - it was very perfectly done with only a handful of irregularities.  I am sad that the author died, but will happily read the other two books as they are published.",,
Hoople,"Reviewed in the United States on November 26, 2009",,5.0 out of 5 stars,Must Read,"With nearly 700 reviews, many of them rave, I feel silly even writing one but what the heck.Having lost mucho dough in the economic downturn I had an aversion to the book out of the gate, it initially having much to do with economics and investigative reporting. However, I was soon swept up in the strange charm this book wields over most people who pick it up. It quickly becomes much more than a book about the markets and the media. There is something awkwardly dated about the writing and story, even when a translation is taken into account. The anachronistic effect of once trendy topics set in the context of a culture not your own (so the twists and turns, environments, mores and traditions are news - they drink an awful lot of coffee in Sweden and at all hours) renders the story both fresh and familiar. This quality adds to the charm and vibrant mystery of the novel. And while it is not in the least devoid of a dark side, creepy scenes are energetic and exciting but not so murky they left me wanting a shower. Also, the computer geek, so exhausted a character at this point, felt new and unusual - not at all clichéd. It is a fully engaging, unique page turner.",,

It wasn't what I would call a page-turner but I would always get back to the story every chance I could. However, I found some of the writing to be a bit unrealistic but it is a novel. I did have higher expectations of realism than what the author gave. Once I accepted some of the unrealistic character traits I continued to enjoy it.

I liked Larsson's book and plowed through it in two long settings.  After just finishing three 1930s Euro-spy books by Allan Furst, I found myself doing comparison/contrast.  Both ably take on political issues in Europe, including Nazis away from Europe's main-stage; both paint their scenery well.  Both have lead males who are well loved by the ladies, but Larsson does a richer job building interesting characters.I think I learned a lot about life in Sweden--a country I know little about.  And I probably most enjoyed his thoughtful reflection on the serious battling that goes on today between business and the media.  He also understands modern electronics well enough to nicely incorporate it into the plot.  The murder-villianry was, for my taste, needlessly over-the-top.  Perhaps it was inserted to sex up some future movie deal?  Whatever the case, I'm glad there was plenty of business intrigue left after the eruptions to nicely tidy up the finish.",,
M. Smith,"Reviewed in the United States on October 18, 2009",One person found this helpful,5.0 out of 5 stars,A very satisfying read.,"At last, a book that holds your attention, and makes it worth your while spending time with it.  Even once past the massive introduction, the story moves easily and quickly, through a variety of different scenes.  The descriptions are well detailed, easily putting you in the picture.  All the characters are fascinating and complete.  There certainly are some disturbing scenes in the book, but considering all the violence we're subject to in the media in these times, they are no worse than the worst, and needed to support the plot and its characters' motivations.  I found it much easier to move through these pages of violence, than to look at today's television blood and guts hospital surgical/crime drama realism.The only complaint I have is the number of characters, which required me to create a list as I read, for later reference.  It was worth the effort, and the story could not have been told without such a large cast.  The story is loaded with (to us Yanks) an alternate international setting, an involved family soap opera, financial misdeeds and schemes, publishing operations, legal drama and consequences, WWII detritus, adult relationships, and ultimately morality vs. immorality. I loved the timing, and the surprisingly early denouement, only to be pleasantly aware that the book still had more to go. My favorite book this year, too.",,
Combined Text,"Reviewed in the United States on April 21, 2011",,3.0 out of 5 stars,Deatiled and Alive,"Mikael Blomkvist is really the protagonist in this novel. The Girl... is really more of a supporting actress. Larsson draws the reader in with mundane detail that makes a fiction story seem like reality. The book comes to life with enough plot line to have an engaged reader remember every turn towards the finish. The parts when Salander makes an appearance are the most exciting. I Plan to read the rest of the series to continue the adventure.As fiction goes, this is pretty standard. The story has a way of working itself out that is masterful in the way it is crafted (with each character fulfilling his/her role) but also too perfect to be believable. Larsson's attention to detail earn high marks as well as the interwoven complex story with many identifiable personalities, however the sentimental lack of conflict is hard to grasp in a supposedly suspenseful mystery novel. In fact, I think the suspense is too far drawn out in between climaxes, that it doesn't allow the reader to continue interest through some of the dull parts. There seems to be an endless supply of money, resources and energy in this book that allow an impossible mystery to be solved by the most tedious scrutiny of a single detail.",,

J Shulman,"Reviewed in the United States on October 28, 2009",One person found this helpful,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is Great Fiction, Not Just A Great Mystery","I found this book a while ago due to the bright cover and the need to kill time in a boutique bookstore while my son was with his math tutor. And along with Caleb Carr's The Alienist, which I also found in the same bookstore years before because of its cover, this is a great piece of original mystery fiction that should be regarded as excellent fiction rather than just a mystery. The success of this work and the next book - The Girl Who Played with Fire - testifies to its qualify. The girl in question is a Dickensian character but totally twenty first century - a combination I did not think possible. Her male counterpart is something of a cad by American standards -- but also a hero journalist American readers should be as comfortable with as any other ""outsider"" going after the truth. I read a couple of books a week and have written two mysteries I am now trying to get published and I envy the late Mr. Larsson's ability to write - even in translation his work is wonderful.

One that grabs you from the very first sentence and makes you hold your breath throughout until the last word?  I recently read one of those.  And if you are a mystery lover then you know those kind of books are few and far between.  I had seen The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo by Stieg Larsson in the bookstores, online, just about everywhere but had resisted the urge to pick it up for some reason.  When I finally gave in to all of the hype about the book, I was so glad I did.  I could not believe a flawed hero and kick-ass heroine with too many problems to count could become the greatest crime-solving team in recent history.  I have been telling everyone I know to RUN, don't walk, to get this book.So after I read Mr. Larsson's first book in what is called the ""Millenium Trilogy"" I had to know more about this author. I wanted to read everything I could get my hands on of his.  Unfortunately, he passed away of a sudden heart attack in 2004.  His whole trilogy is being published posthumously.  Not only did I discover he was from Sweden, but he was the chief editor of Expo, an anti-fascist magazine published in Sweden.  His life reads like a James Bond movie; it's no wonder he could write Lisbeth Salandar's character with so much life!",,
Bill Branley,"Reviewed in the United States on October 6, 2012",,4.0 out of 5 stars,Will Get You Eventually,"Some reviewers complain that this book starts slow.  It's true that there's a lot of setup before the story gets going, but I don't think it's wasted.  The story itself is complicated, and the characters lives are as complicated as the modern tech-heavy world in which they live. So I personally didn't mind the author spending some time explaining things, and once it takes off it really rocks.There's a lot of specific detail in the book about things, people, places, technology, events.  Sometimes the detail seems overwhelming and I found myself wondering how the book became so popular.  Do readers really like all that detail?  I don't know the answer but you don't necessarily need to absorb every sentence that is offered.  I mean if you don't care how a hacker can completely take over someone's computer you can skim that part and still enjoy the story.  Maybe some readers need that sense of realism.The main female character, Lisbeth Salander, is by far the most interesting person in the story.  I'm imagining that the author had a message in mind when he created a story where a counter-culture, anti-social, skinny misfit of a woman makes it possible for an incredibly complex riddle to be solved but gets little credit in the end.  When you discover some of the other themes in the story you might agree.  He seems to want to champion the cause of women who have not gotten the best treatment in society.  By the way, some of the gutsy stunts she pulls off are amazing.The plot keeps unfolding until the end.  Just when you think you know what's going on there's another layer to unravel.I'll probably read the next one.",,

Sometimes they served a literary purpose and sometimes they just horrified me.2) This may be a problem with translating from the Swedish, but I often felt that the dialogue fell a bit flat.

When I picked it up and started to tell people I was going to read it I started to hear mixed reviews. I kept and open mind and dove in.However, it was hard to dive in because it was very slow and hard to get into. Around 40% of the way through I started to worry that I had made a mistake. But I kept trudging along. And then BAM, at 49% it turns into a speeding train and a fascinating story.Where it took me two weeks to read the first half of the book, it took me 3 days to finish it. I realized at the end of the book, while reading the about the author section, that the author had planned this being a trilogy which would explain the in depth character introduction.Overall I give this book 4 stars and a heads up that the read will have to power through that first half but after that it's completely worth the read.

Blomqvist is a journalist that runs into trouble with a story he did, but is put on a mission to solve a historic crime. When these two characters unite, the story takes on a thrilling new twist.

Henrik finally hires a down-on his luck journalist by the name of Mikael Bloomkvist to pick up on the investigation where Henrik himself gave up.  The cororate and financial aspects of this novel were a bore for me.  It was also hard for me to feel totally immersed in this story  because the names and locations of the towns in Sweden got in the way.  I liked the charachters, though and their relationships to each other.  The characters were all very fleshed out at the beginning of the book, but they continued to grow as the story progressed.

The middle aged divorced journalist meets the childhood-abused, tattooed and pierced, twenty-something girl, who happens to be a world class hacker and have a photographic memory.

It's honestly just not all that good. Larsson uses 200 words where a couple dozen could do. The endless exposition of pointless detail doesn't add color or excitement, just pages... and pages... and pages.  In contrast to the mind numbing detail about every aspect of every room, and the endless and often pointless development of people who are not involved in the least in the story, you have the hilariously unimaginative ever present staple of coffee and sandwiches. Evidently, based on this book, a Swede's near total dietary consumption is made up of coffee and sandwiches. I think there was only one time where he even mentioned what kind of sandwich, but you'll know every detail about every room anyone enters.  Perhaps it was a subliminal suggestion to keep the reader interested in making coffee and thereby awake enough to keep going.I won't go into all the plot details as others have already done so. Just know that it's a grind of a read. There are a few morsels of plot interest to keep you feeling like you may as well hang in there to see how it ends, but overall you end up feeling like an abused spouse who just sticks around hoping that your partner will get better. To wit, since I bought all 3, I waded into book two. Now at 30%, I'm finding myself in the same boat. Too much time invested and a smidge of curiosity are all that's keeping me from going to the menu on my Kindle and starting over with another book.If you're a golfer like me, who has maybe a half dozen nice shots out of 95, and those half dozen shots are enough to keep you slogging through the other ones while wondering why in the hell you didn't just stay home and have coffee and sandwiches, then this series is for you.

I walked into this novel having no idea what the plot was and was truly shocked by the graphic cruelty described throughout the book. The book describes in detail different types of physical violence and torture done to women (sometimes men) in the central plot and subplots. It feels like the compelling story is a lucky by-product, as the book was simply a tool for Laarson to expose the dark reality of human cruelty, especially violence against women, which is likely why the character developments for all the characters and side-characters are quite fragmented. It often feels like a character is just put in there so a type of harm done to them can be written. It's not that the story is not good--it is, but the theme of sexual violence, including the cruelties that are described, could have still been properly conveyed with a tighter writing and a tighter plotline, without all the fragmented subplots within. There were too many stories in there that could be broken into separate books as well.Real Hero: Still a ManIronically for a book that centres mostly on the victimization of women, it seems to spend a little too much time on the main male protagonist of the book. Often times it feels like he's the real hero and this world that Larsson created is just for him, and Lisbeth Salander is just his sidekick who knows how to get information. The book title should have stayed with ""Men who Hate Women,"" as the book focuses on all the men in the series and all women had very little role besides playing victim, including Lisbeth Salander. Though Lis does fight back hard unlike the rest of the women in the story, her role was very small in comparison to the main guy. It does not feel like a book that champions women at all. As opposed to ""Look at all the crap that's done to women you didn't know about, let's empower people to do something about it,"" it's more like, ""Look, here's all the crap you didn't know that is done to women. Man saves day with help of woman.""Product PlacementI was also quite shocked with the details on the branding of all the hardware used in the book. Apple products and specific models are described in detail. There were other brands described that were used by the main characters, but Apple definitely is the winner. I could have done without any of that.Overall Read-worthy?I'm a bit conflicted on this. The plot and the violence draws you in completely and you want to keep reading to see how it plays out--some of which is disappointing. The plot is old, the stories are great, the narrative is engaging, and the writing is mediocre. Not surprisingly, the book is not by any means literary and if you give it the expectation of a simple dime crime novel, then it will definitely exceed your expectation. But you are looking for literature, then you will be sorely disappointed. And, like I said, if you are not used to graphic details of torture and sexual violence, then this book is going to be torturous for you.",,
AlanC,"Reviewed in the United States on February 16, 2010",One person found this helpful,4.0 out of 5 stars,A great ride for a long while . . . and then the fizzle,"If I had stopped to review this book three-quarters of the way through I would have given it a full five stars.  It was that entertaining, compelling, and well done.  The story kept me flipping pages, the characters were engaging and well drawn, and -- let's face it -- there are few literary devices as effective as an expertly turned Dysfunctional Family With Secrets.  I think Larsson is a wonderful talent and I plan to jump happily into his next two (and, sadly, final) books.  That said, he bites off a bit more than he can chew here.  Like many first novels, this one is too ambitious.  There are really two stories here . . . and they are not linked as well as you'll hope. First, there is the disgraced journalist who has been burned by a vengeful corporate titan and is looking for redemption.  Then there is the tale of young Harriet, who disappeared one afternoon back in 1966.  Her uncle -- who cared for her and has been tormented by her disappearance (and more to the point, by the mystery of her fate) -- convinces the journalist to take up his cause and spend a year sequestered at the family compound in a remote part of Sweden, looking into the crime (if, indeed, there even was one).The mystery is (for a long time) well done . . . lots of twists, intrigue (if ever a family compound needed a resident shrink, this is the one), and mystery.  Some of the detective work is novel, clever, and well done, too (without giving anything away, there is some fascinating work with photographs here).  There are, of course, the all-too-convenient Eureka moments, and by the end, we've wandered into rather unconvincing Silence of the Lambs/Red Dragon territory (for a better take on that, read Silence of the Lambs and Red Dragon).  But, somewhat disappointing climax aside, it's a great ride while it lasts.But that leads us to my main problem with this book: There's too much of it.  Perhaps it's because I'm a journalist myself, but I found the entire second plot line -- the attempt to investigate and bring down the aforementioned corporate titan, and all the inside baseball magazine intrigue -- a bore.  And fairly laughable in parts, too (for one thing, we journalists are far too chatty and dysfunctional to carry out any kind of secret, coordinated operation to smoke out a mole).  Worst of all, it's largely unnecessary.  Larsson was a journalist and magazine editor himself, and I can see that it must have been tempting to bring in a little of his own world, but that old adage of write what you know is largely bunk.  Indeed, what's exciting to you (because you live it) isn't always exciting to others.  This plot thread is a case in point.  I think it would have been sufficient to give enough backstory to set up the Disgraced Journalist Looking or Redemption and then move on -- and stick with -- the main story, the mystery of the girl.  This secondary plot also makes our hero look a bit too holier-than-though for comfort (he's always railing about failed financial journalism - annoying enough -- yet many of his arguments and conclusions seem oddly naive and misinformed.  It just detracts, and has readers (at least this one) take him a bit less seriously).  The book would have worked better if this whole sideline was expunged and the mystery built out a bit more.A couple of lesser gripes: While I can appreciate that Larsson was clearly an Apple fan boy (no problem with that here), his computer talk is at turns superficial and weird.  He lists the entire spec sheet of a 2002-era PowerBook laptop one character has her pocketbook set on . . . I have no idea why.  And when he talks about encryption and hacking it is clear that he doesn't know that much about either (and no, knowing what PGP is does not qualify you as an expert).  On the other hand, I think the only reason this bothered me was that so much else in the book was so well crafted and presented.  On a related note, I also thought that the character profile of the private investigator who helps out on the case -- and is the real heroine of the story -- was by turns fascinating and rubbish.  At one moment she's borderline autistic; the next she is assuming identities and interacting with bankers on million-dollar transactions.  The romance -- all of it -- is a bit too convenient and unconvincing, too.  Finally, it was a minor bummer that some of the most fascinating characters in the book -- the head of the security concern, the uncle himself, to name a couple -- get sidelined along the way, only to make cursory appearances thereafter.I may have had to drag myself through the last fifth of the book, but no regrets.  This was clearly one of the better thrillers to come along of late, and I plan to get cracking on Book 2 promptly.",,
Cynthia,"Reviewed in the United States on November 20, 2010",,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Light, fun reading","This is a perfect `airplane' book.  Think `Da Vinci Code', `The Time Traveler's Wife' or `Harry Potter'.  Actually I put off reading it for just that comparison.  When a good friend whose opinion I respect told me how much they liked it I took my nose out of the air and stuck it in the book.  Larson is(was) a great entertainer.  There are lots of surprises and excitement.  The girl character aka Salander steals the show because you can never quite figure out her motivations and Larson does a good job of pre-figuring his upcoming books through her.  He gives you just enough information on her background to make you want to read more.As a side note I usually have issues reading in translation because I worry I'm missing nuances but this was a very well done Swedish to English version.  By the way the Swedish movie version is excellent and fairly true to the book, one of those rare movies that are almost better than the book.",,

The author is obviously very well informed with the world of Journalism. Also, there's the Nazi touch. Its a great story and I have been sitting in the wee hours of the morning just because I was totally involved with the storyline and could not wait to read the end!! After the climax, the author devotes several pages to explain the ending in detail, trying to trim all the lose ends...On the downside, I am not a big fan of violence and the torture in the story, leaves with a bad taste in the mouth, hence the four stars...

Brendan,"Reviewed in the United States on November 26, 2009",,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Intriguing Story, Sometimes Too Flawed Characters","The plot of this novel was very interesting. I've read reviews here that found it slow, which surprised me. I found the story compelling, and moving along at a good pace.The main characters are well-voiced, but I did find that at times, Larsson is really stretching the readers' limits to keeping loyal to our heroes.For such a well-written book, for instance, Larsson uses the hackneyed detective genre convention of making his main character, Blomkvist,  a Lothario. In a book that is a self-professed analysis of violence against women (the original Swedish title is Men Who Hate Women), this is a strange choice. His casual attitude towards sex makes for a strange dichotomy with the violence portrayed by some of the antagonists. Along the same lines, at one point, his relationship with this daughter is addressed with a throwaway line ""he was not a good father.""Similarly, so much time is spent getting to know Henrik Vanger, that when we find he's treated his relationship with Blomkvist in a way that surprises us, we don't get much of an emotional payoff-- it's just left up in the air.Again, I felt the plot was an interesting one, and certainly a recommended read, just be prepared for a small level of frustration with the character inconsistencies.",,

Like Dan Brown's ""The Da Vince Code"" maybe the book was over hyped to me and thus I was mildly disappointed.I won't repeat the story; because it is well covered in other reviews. I did like the protaganist, Mikael Blomkvist. And like most people, I really enjoyed the quiet, intelligent, confident, punk Lisbeth Salander. Despite my disappointment with the ending of the book, I will read at least the second book in the series to spend more time with Blomkvist and Salander.The story kept my interest through most of the book. I just felt that the discovery of the fate of Harriet Vanger was a bit lame. Also the unsavory shenanigans of Martin Vanger and his father over such a long period of time was over the top and too incredible.I realize the comments are sketchy; but I don't wish to spoil the ending.

I liked the idea of dark family secrets of the rich and famous.....and the Vanger family is full of sinister secrets and characters. The fact that the mystery spread over a significant period of time added a lot to the plot for me. I found myself wondering how much the time had affected the memories of the characters....it created a similar feeling that an unreliable narrator does for the reader.Besides a few minor distractions, I'm intrigued by the series to say the least. It is a fresh, modern thriller that clearly appeals to the masses. It was fast paced once I got into it and past the initial financial set up. Blomkvist and Salander make a good team and I look forward to seeing their relationship develop in the coming books.See my full review here: [...]",,

I'm not going to talk about the actual story because others have done a great job of it.  I'm going to talk about the reading experience.It took me close to 100 pages to get into it, just as my friend had warned me.  I believe the problem is that there are a lot of Swedish names of streets, buildings, towns etc. that are hard to wrap our minds around because they are long and unfamiliar.  At any rate, just as she said, all of a sudden this book grabbed me and I couldn't put it down.  I was reading half the night.  Although I couldn't read full time, I read all 3 of the trilogy within 4 or 5 days.This was supposed to be the first book of a 10 book series, but unfortunately, the author died while writing book 4.

I'm glad I still made the choice to read the book though!I thought it was going to be really hard to follow, with all of the various characters from the Vanger family, but Stieg Larsson wrote in such a way that everyone was actually quite easy to keep track of. There are quite a few little differences between the book and the movie, but nothing that made things confusing.The only thing that I wasn't crazy about was the extensive introduction into Blomkvist's background. It went into quite a bit of detail about the financial occurences that he had researched about Wennerstrom that led to his being convicted of libel. I'm not the most well-versed in that area, so it was a little difficult for me to get into it.I would definitely recommend this book to anyone who enjoys a good investigation with many twists and turns!

Characters at time come at you fast and furious.  But I liked the book and am on the second in the series.  The story is a bit predictable but it still kept my interest.  The mystery was solved with about 60 or so pages to go and I hoped there would be a hook thrown in there so something would be left unresolved.  That was not the case and the pages at the end just wind down the story.One thing that snagged the reading was all of the Swedish names (mostly the streets and towns) and trying to figure out how to pronounce them.  With all the names of streets that ended in ""gatan"" I'm guessing that is used in place of ""street"" or ""road"".I still think it's a good read and would recommend it anyone who likes fiction and mysteries.",,

It's hard to follow and has more characters and subplots than any feasible human can keep up with. The Vagner family- which plays an integral role in the plot- is huge with an extensive web of relationships. Where do these people think they're from? Kentucky? (that comment is slightly ominous, but read it to find out why).Once you settle past enough exposition to make you feel like you're reliving the entire Obama campaign (which, in my mind started in 2004 at the DNC), it's actually quite an engaging read. The premise is strikingly simple despite the complexity of the set-up. Harriet Vagner has been missing for over four decades and a journalist- recently discredited in a libel indictment- has been hired to write the Vagner family biography and see if he can solve the mystery of Vagner's murder or disappearance. Now that I'm writing this, this kind of sounds like an absurdist Eastern European version of Jason Glass's life, which arguably got more popular once it was discovered his work was rooted in as much truth as a Harry Potter novel.The author could do a slightly better job clarifying exactly what is going on at times, but about midway through the text, I was hooked.

The characters were different from the norm and the two main characters (Blomvkist and Salander), extremely complex and likeable.  Most of all, it was a crime novel that didn't involve lawyers, the police, the FBI, the CIA, or the military.  I think that is what made it such a fresh read for me.  That, and the fact that the setting is Sweden, gave it a nice feel for this American reader.  (Spoiler Alert)  The only part that I did not like about TGWTDT was the really, stinking, beyond lame, terrible, horrible no good, very bad and disappointing ending.

When I opened it and started reading it, the book started off extremely slow and I could barely make it through the prologue. A year later, I got my first kindle and on a whim, purchased this book for the Kindle thinking maybe I'd give it another shot and not have to lug around a huge book with me wherever I went. Two years since I've finished this book (and I read the other two in the trilogy as well) and I have yet to find a story and characters that have drawn me in as well as the Millennium Trilogy. Lisbeth Salander is one of the most complex characters I've ever come across and she's somewhat unpredictable. While this book does start off slow, and does drag on in some parts, you will not be disappointed by this story by any means. It is too bad Larsson passed away before being able to witness the success of his novels and see how popular they've grown to be.

Upon reflection, after finishing this book, I decided that part of its appeal lies in the fact that many if not most of human drives and emotions are present somewhere in the story:  greed. lust, love, revenge, sadism, sloth, political extremism, fear, and deceit, among others.  The author combines all these good and bad human traits into a lyrically-written mystery with overtones of irony and undercurrents of violence.  The book is well-organized, too, which makes it eminently readable.  There is a flow to the words that is addictive:  when you add that to the story, the result is a marvelous read.

I actually had to keep notes and draw a sketch of the family tree - which, thankfully, was provided.  That being said, I still enjoyed the book well enough and would recommend reading it.

I had somewhat heard the hype about it, but I just didn't think it was something that I would be interested in. Boy, was I mistaken. It did start a little slow so it took me about two days to actually want to get into it (or try to get past the first 100 pgs.), but once I did get into it, it was hard to put down. It was a fast-paced, intelligent, whodunnit mystery. The character of Lizbeth Salander was totally kick-ass. There were some parts that were a bit hard to swallow, but overlooking that, it was a fascinating read. The only thing I wasn't too big on were all the Swedish words that I know I butchered throughtout the whole novel. So in conclusion, The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo was all that it was said to be and more.",,

This mystery is compulsively readable, particularly because of the two protagonists, a middle-aged, male Swedish journalist and a twenty-something female private investigator. He has just been convicted of libel, and she has been abused by men during her short life. A series of bizarre events bring them together to investigate a decades old murder within a dysfunctional family. The writing provides insight into European capitalism, male/female relationships, investigative techniques, moral and ethical ambiguities, and contemporary Swedish culture.",,
Caleb Hummel,"Reviewed in the United States on July 27, 2010",2 people found this helpful,4.0 out of 5 stars,An enjoyable read,"When I began reading the first of this trilogy by Stieg Larrson I was anticipating a non-stop, jam-packed action story filled with intrigue, suspense and thrills. About half-way through I realized that this would not be the case. Though deceptively slow paced, Larsson pieced together a story that was hard to put down even without the Dan Brown-esque thrills.The strength of the story is without a doubt the characters. Larsson spends a great deal of time introducing the reader to all the major players in his story. The characters are often quirky and one gets the impression from the beginning that all of the have something to hide. It is easy to like the main characters of Blomkvist and Salander from very early on.There were two things about this story that were somewhat annoying. First, Larsson tends to be unnecessarily repetitive about certain details. I found myself wishing he had given the reader more credit in remember key details. The second thing had to do with the ending of the book. I don't want to give too much away, but there is a scene towards the end that is perhaps one of the most suspenseful of the entire story and it gets downplayed in the overall narrative. I'm not sure what the author was attempting to accomplish with this section of the book, but it seemed out of place with the rest of the narrative.Regarding the language, please note that this was originally written in Swedish and later translated to English. At times it is glaringly obvious that the book is a translation, but overall it does not affect the readers flow.Overall, I think this is a wonderful, gripping story about several individuals. It is not the Steve Berry or Dan Brown type suspense story that it is sometimes billed as being. I look forward to diving into the other two books in this series in the hopes that they focus more on plot than on the characters.",,

Although the author creates one of the most interesting characters ever in Lisbeth, he bogs down the story with multiple plot lines. The main plot , which the movie focuses on is well paced and interesting but the secondary plot of the journalist's battle against an evil corporate CEO is useless and the movie appropriately cuts most of this out. Unfortunately 1/4th of the novel involves this uninteresting storyl line including the end. The main plot is solved with about 150 pages left only to revisit the journalist's revenge against the CEO.With that said, this book is worth reading for the character Lisbeth Salander alone. It gives a more insight into this dark but intelligent person. I only wish the WHOLE story was about her only!",,

One of the main characters, Lisbeth, is fairly well drawn and interesting, while in my opinion, Blomqvist, was never rounded-out.  The chapter title quotations made it clear that the author wanted to be sensitive to the issues of sexism and the abuse of females, but I still felt that many of the scenes portrayed women as powerless.  For example, the murderer tortured and killed helpless women in pretty graphic detail and all of the primary female characters were EAGER to have sex with Blomqvist.  On the other hand, Lisbeth, manages to empower herself over a man who is abusing her, and does not live a ""and she lived happily ever after with the prince"" future, a conclusion that I appreciated.",,

I pulled for the quirky, tough, mighty mouse Lisbeth, the socially laid back, professionally driven Mikael, the funky new-age married Erika, and the kindly, sickly, closure-seeking Henrik.

There is no romanticism in this book, or lust, really. Emotionally, it's very sterile; whatever the characters do is motivated by logic.

The Wennerstrom issue served as a vehicle to make the Vanger story plausible, but I felt it was poorly developed and took away from the ending of the book.

Yes, it is graphic and disturbing at times but its unsavoriness is totally apt given its plot. Steig Larson is an excellent writer and an exquisite story teller. It is a shame that he only published three novels in his lifetime; quality over quantity, I suppose.I have to say that what impressed me the most about this novel was how place and culture oriented it was. As an American relatively ignorant of Swedish culture and geography, I feel that I was not only stimulated by a very compelling storyline but I was also educated in this unique part of the world; it's geography, politics, history, social policies and culture being so remarkably different from what I am familiar with in America.Additionally, the main character Lisbeth Salandar is truly one of the most unique and memorable heroines ever devised. One could write a whole book simply examining the psychological profile of this fictional character.

The audiobook is difficult to listen to because the reader (Martin Wenner) does not adjust his voice enough to distinguish between the characters.  Often throughout listening to this audiobook it was difficult to determine who was talking.  I've listened to every Harry Potter book and this book doesn't even come close.  Jim Dale does an excellent job distinguishing his voice for several different characters.  He does such an excellent job that you can visualize each character while listening to the Harry Potter series.  Martin on the other hand with this book barely distinguishes his voice, if at all.The book content itself is entertaining, but the plot is predictable.

I purchased this book after it was recommended (read: I was coerced!) by my mother, sister, and cousin to read it, and I am certainly glad they pressured me to do so. It was always on my radar to read it, but because I am a slow reader and am intimidated by the potential idea of hard-to-read books, I had postponed reading it a few times.What they said about the book is true though. Getting into the book can be challenging because of the Swedish names and locations, but the author did a very good job of going into great lengths to explain things in detail so that the reader is truly never really lost. If you've started reading it and have put it down, give it another chance.I have heard conflicting things about the book, but mostly positive.  There are events in the book that feminists will not be happy about, but think I can understand what the author was trying to convey even if may have come out wrong to some.Nonetheless, the book is griping and it's a fascinating tale.

dizzyweasel,"Reviewed in the United States on February 8, 2009",12 people found this helpful,4.0 out of 5 stars,Men Who Hate Women,"This book starts slow (and I do mean slow - 100 pages of explanation of Swedish finance and economics to establish the background), but suddenly pulls the reader in. While the elaborate set-up is sometimes tedious, it is completely necessary to create a backdrop to the mystery, which actually ends 100 pages before the end of the novel. The final 100 pages are then payoff for all of your studying in the first 100, and presumably lay the groundwork for the next two books in the trilogy. In short, stick out those slow opening chapters, it's worth it.The story's setup is a traditional 'locked room' mystery. Forty years ago the favorite granddaughter of one of Sweden's captains of industry, Henrik Vanger, went missing, presumably murdered. Blomkvist, the lately down-and-out journalist, is hired to do a biography of the Vanger family and maybe solve the mystery along the way. He eventually ends up with a research partner in Lisbeth Salander, a gothed out, anti-social, abused young woman with Asperger's Syndrome. She is cold, analytical, and angry. She always gets even. And you will love her. Will they solve the mystery? Will they be killed along the way? Will Blomkvist regain his journalistic credibility? These are the surface concerns that drive the mystery.The Swedish title of the book is something closer to Men Who Hate Women, and the entire book revolves around this theme. Not just in the murder mystery portion, but in the social interactions of the male and female characters. The Sweds are clearly as misogynistic as the rest of the West. This is the real plot that drives the book. The author handles his theme deftly. Larsson is clearly sympathetic to the omnipresent dangers to women in porno-driven, patriarchal, Western society. His scenes of violence are never gratuitous, and he does not linger on the abuse of women in a voyeuristic way, unlike so many films, tv shows, and books that seem to relish the display of imperiled women. Larsson also reverses sexual stereotypes (not as feminist as rejecting them altogether, but it's a place to start); his male lead, Blomkvist, does not run around 'saving' the women in this novel. His female lead Salander is no damsel in distress. She relies on no one but herself and is perfectly capable of extracting herself from dangerous situations by using her analytical brain. Through Salander (clearly Larsson's favorite character, despite the initial focus on Blomkvist) Larsson comments on the failed governmental structures in place to prevent abuse, the unpleasant daily capitulations women must make to save themselves, and the unfortunate realities for women who fall between the cracks of society. Not only does Larsson comment, he gets angry. And you *definitely* want to see Salander angry.The 100 pages at the end of the book wrapping the story back around to the first 100 are increasingly implausible. The tale takes a veer into Jennifer-Garner-in-Alias territory before the book's denouement. On the whole though, a satisfying mystery, a thought-provoking social commentary, and a solid beginning to what promises to be a riveting trilogy.",VINE VOICE,

I'd like to add that I was very satisfied with the translation and also that I learned some new things about a different country and it's culture as the story is based in Sweden.I enjoyed this so much I've already bought the 2 sequels. As I just finished 'The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo' I stopped here to deliver this review while I looked up which book is the next in the series (turns out it's 'The Girl Who Played With Fire') and now I'm off to start my next literary adventure!,,

Holmes,"Reviewed in the United States on April 20, 2010",,4.0 out of 5 stars,Review of The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo,"This was certainly not the best book I have read this year, but it was good enough for me to buy the second book in the trilogy. If you personally knew me that should tell you enough right there about this book.I had heard a lot of people talking about how great this book was so I bought the kindle version for my iphone. I don't feel it was as great as everyone said it was, but I definitely enjoyed the time I spent reading it.  The ending seemed very exciting and the author did a great job tying all the loose ends together at the end. The characters were beleivable for the most part, though there were a couple of instances I thought were a bit over the top.This is a good book, not five stars, but I think it is worth the money and I beleive you will have an enjoyable time reading it.",,

The book was definately a page turner I couldnt put it down. Once I finished the book I needed to know the rest of the story so I bought the 2nd book in the series and once again it was soo worth it. I dont know which one was better because both story lines were so good. But you definately have to read the books in order or somethings just wont make sense.

I first saw the story in the american-language film with Daniel Craig, then a friend made me aware that all three books were made into Swedish films, so I ordered them from Amazon, and they were good too.  I decided to get the first book because, at heart, I am a reader and the books always contain more meat than is feasible to include in a film.

Threaded across the book is a theme of abuse of trust, position and power, friendship and baseless assumptions, we follow Mikael Blomkvist, a disgraced journalist who works his way through his ""sabbatical"" year ""writing a biography""... there is more than meets the eye.For people who like mysteries and good scares, The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo is it. I won't go into too much details because alot of it has to be experienced. On the good side, I love it. there's mini cliffhangers throughout the whole book, both mini and big twists and enough questions (raised by you as the reader) to push you along the whole book. It's heart pounding because of the cliffhangers, and plenty of jaw dropping thoughts lined throughout the book.I absolutely fell in love with it. of course, there are very few books that I have chosen based on their summaries and recommendations that I would dislike, with the massive exception of Ian Irvine whom I still loathe - but I digress.On the minus side, which isn't a big issue for me, it seems that they have found those books unpublished and just go ""woah i see something good in it"" and threw it into the publishing without too much editing. Granted that because it is a 3 book series, there should be plenty of descriptives involve so everything is easily fleshed out. At one point though, it did feel like it was information overload. There's also plenty of Apple vs PC references (main characters uses Macs while villians were stupid pc users HAHAHAAH) which I laughed to death about, and adore (as you can see, I am an Apple fangirl). There are many people who did complain about it though and the descriptions, much less the branding, was completely unnecessary.",,

As for the writing style, yes some of the writing is poor or not realistic; however, with a good editor, those areas could have easily been resolved.  Just remember that John Steinbeck's editor had to send The Grapes of Wrath back to him more times than he liked before it went to print.I like it for what it is, a mystery/thriller novel which in my opinion has been a much better reading than some of these ""romance novels"" masked as a mystery/thriller novels.Am I going to read the other two novels to find out how the characters of Blomkvist and Salander further evolve?

Mr. Larsson had a real talent for writing in ways that kept me glued to the pages, beginning to end.

Jill I. Shtulman,"Reviewed in the United States on October 6, 2008",3 people found this helpful,4.0 out of 5 stars,The most original heroine in quite some time,"There are two key protagonists here:  a Swedish journalist in his forties named Mikael Blomkvist, who exposes financial corruption via his gadfly news magazine, Millennium, and is successfully sued for libel.  And then there's the star:  Lisbeth Salander, one of the most original characters in years.  This emotionally-stunted, violence-inflicted computer hacker sports various tattoos and body piercings, probably suffers from Asperger's Syndrome, and has been under state guardianship in Sweden since she was not more than a child.When Blomkvist is enticed to live in the middle of nowhere to investigate the presumed murder of the grand-niece of the semi-retired industrialist, Henrick Vanger, a series of events begin to spiral that brings these two unlikely characters together.  The result is a series of twists and turns as they team up to get to the bottom of this forty-year-old mystery and, at the same time, enable Blomkvist to clear his name and move his leftist watchdog magazine out of the red.The novel really sparkles when it focuses on Lisbeth, who is unique and captivating. The revenge scene had me cheering;  I can imagine how it would play on the big screen.  The book loses its edge as the mystery begins to be solved.  No spoilers, but the evil doer, who was at least moderately fleshed out, acts and sounds like a cartoon character during the long-awaited revelation.  The novel then began to sound like an old-fashioned Perry Mason episode.I have read that Stieg Larsson was the editor-in-chief of Expo, an anti-racist magazine.  It makes sense, then, that the book becomes a conduit for causes that Larsson feels passionately about:  violence and subjugation of women, right-wing extremism, and the incompetency of the media.  I found the book to be a true page-turner -- I read all 467 pages at one sitting during a transcontinental flight -- with enough substance to keep me intrigued throughout.",TOP 1000 REVIEWER VINE VOICE,

The first 80 pages or so sets up the conflict which some may find slow. Many characters are introduced but a family tree in the beginning of the book makes it easy to follow. The story then picks up and at times becomes too much like a Hollywood movie. For those who enjoy fast paced action, they will not be disappointed. There are also a few subplots which makes the book interesting by giving it more dimensions.The book is not really fine literature and the writing (or perhaps the translation) is simple.

I still don't understand what all the fuss was about. Perhaps it is better in its original language, but the translation was awkward and stilted. As a result, I found it difficult to get through. I think people mistake the bursts of gratuitous violence for bona fide action in an otherwise boring book. Plus, the characters, with the possible exception of Lisbeth, are all fairly one-dimensional.I understand that the point of the book is to bring attention to violence against women, which I appreciate. The execution of this goal, however, was in my opinion, poor due to lack of character development and stilted writing.",,

Mr. August,"Reviewed in the United States on November 17, 2008",2 people found this helpful,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Intrigue, murder, violence and love!","This is an outstanding book for a reader who wants an intellectual murder story mixed with unusual historical Swedish commerce, family saga, fascism and corruption.  I thoroughly enjoyed this novel and as an American, I learned more than I thought I would about the structure of Sweden's system.The story revolves around Mikael Blomkvist, who although he is convicted of libel, is hired by the scion of the prominent Vanger family to solve a possible murder (many years prior) of his niece, Harriet Vanger.  The book contained a page of the family tree which I bookmarked separately as I need to keep referring to the vast family for clarification.Blomkvist is characterized a brilliant journalist and a ladies' man who is hardworking and determined to chronicle the murder and the Vanger biography.  The family is rife with selfish, crazy and egocentric people which makes the story interesting on every page.Paired with Blomkvist is Lisbeth Salander, a 24 year old, who had a deplorable childhood.  She is a brilliant investigator and computer hacker with a determined streak of violence.  She was a very believable character. I have known some young American women who came up through the foster system and her plight and anger seemed quite realistic to me.In addition to the corruption that unfolds,  I was somewhat astonished to learn how many Swedish women are subjected to sexual assault.This is one of the best novels I have read in a long time.  The translation, I trust, is excellent.  It is very sad to know that Steig Larsson died so young.  He certainly was a gifted and brilliant novelist.

Cathy Bock,"Reviewed in the United States on June 11, 2010",One person found this helpful,3.0 out of 5 stars,Loved the last half,"This book was really hard to get into. I'm not normally into mysteries or the usual bestsellers, but I picked this up to see what all the hype was about. The first half of the story was wretchedly slow, full of long, clunky descriptions and backstory. This really wouldn't be so bad if the description had been perfectly worded and the backstory intriguing. Instead, it was full of cliches and unneeded information. I also felt like the characters were flat and undeveloped.My one other complaint about this novel is its portrayal of women. Perhaps its a cultural gap, but nearly every woman that Mikael encounters is sexually promiscuous. And, of course, they all want to have sex with him. And, of course, he casually agrees. So this stuffy, over-the-hill, one-dimensional news journalist is somehow the sex-god of Sweden. Didn't really compute for me.The last half of the story, while still full of awkward, unneeded information, really picked up steam and made the book worth reading. While it took me several days to get through the first half, I finished the second half of the novel in one evening. I think it was the author's intention to really slow-cook this one and immerse the reader into the world of the Vanger family and the larger scope of Swedish industry before hooking them into the mystery. So if you're giving it a try and finding it difficult to stick with, just carry on and trust that it will be worth it in the end.",,
Doug,"Reviewed in the United States on February 8, 2009",4 people found this helpful,5.0 out of 5 stars,Compelling and well Written,"Instead of retelling the story, I'll make a few of my general observations about what made the book so surprisingly readable:1.  How many books have you read written by a Swedish author from a Swedish perspective?  I found it fascinating to compare what must be the norm regarding Swedish businessmen, a somewhat more liberal feeling about sexual relationships, friendship, normal food, living quarters, all things Swedish.2.  The author was a trained journalist, knows the rules and law of journalism and accurately portrays the writing  and publishing world which can sometimes be brutal and highly competitive.3.  How many of the royal business families in the United States are made up of dozens and dozens of heirs who are made up partially of spoiled and  troubled people with sometimes creepy lives?  The story here is very believable, goes back a couple of generations where the main character journalist is able to uncover some family Nazi roots and bad behavior which have permeated down to the current generation.4.  One of the most compelling and excellent things about the book is the creation of a waifish, backward, tattooed and pierced girl who seems like a total outcast and belongs in an institution.  But as her personality and skills start to unfold and mix with the journalist main character,  she becomes this amazing and even lovable character and I have to admit, that I cared deeply for her and kept holding my breath hoping she wouldn't die.5.  The story is long, meticulous, gets into detail that main American detective writers would never take time to do.  And yet, it is this careful, slow work that makes it all the more believable and when some solutions start to emerge, it has been well worth the wait.6.  There were a few things that were a bit strange to me, a bit over the top, didn't quite seem right, but I don't want to give anything away here.Suffice it to say that I'm very excited for the next book to come out and I can't believe I have to wait until July.The book is adult and R rated with some scenes that will be offensive and hard to take for some readers.",,
T. C. Peterson,"Reviewed in the United States on February 1, 2010",,5.0 out of 5 stars,One of the best bargains ever,"I'm assuming this book has been reviewed to death, so I'll just give my personal observations. Anyone familiar with the news business will like the opening. At the time, I didn't realized that Larsson had been an investigative reporter -- but he obviously knew what he was talking about. But after that, the first part of the book dragged a bit, and there were some sections I would have edited out.However, the later sections more than make up for it. Once Larsson starts writing about the dysfunctional family that the protagonist is supposed to investigate, it becomes instantly interesting. And as the back story gets more and more sordid, the tale becomes increasingly riveting.Of course, a lot of the appeal is the unusual setting. The idea that a place with all these exotic names would have issues and problems so similar to America is what lends the story much of its charm.I actually bought my copy at a warehouse store -- this was something I gave as a Christmas gift, and the recipient absolutely raved about it. He's read a lot of mysteries, and he couldn't put this down.In short, for the Amazon price, this is one of the best bargains you'll ever get. I challenge you to find any competing product (movies, music) that will give you as much enjoyment for six bucks. Getting the sequel was a no-brainer.",,

I don't need to know what processor, how much RAM, how big a hard drive, and other details to grasp that the girl has a top of the line computer...he already said that in the first sentence.It also commits the all too common sin of coming to the climax, and then continuing on for chapter after chapter wrapping up all the loose ends on what was essentially a minor side story.I really wanted to like this one, but wish I had started in the middle and quit after the main plot line wrapped up.",,

The book starts out slowly, if a bit stiffly. I can't help but wonder if the sometimes awkward language has to do with the translation. There were times when I felt myself chafing a bit at the authors prose, but I attributed it to the vast differences between tongues.The book takes a bit to get into - at least for me it did - but when I finally bought into the plot, it was a page turner. The book is quite complex, and has numerous plots and sub plots - so much so that you really do need to reference the included family tree.In the end, definitely worth a read, but perhaps not all of the hype.",,
Gregory Forsthoefel,"Reviewed in the United States on December 9, 2012",,4.0 out of 5 stars,Mostly a Good Story,"The book was very similar to the movie with only one major difference. So if you liked the movie, you'll probably like the book.There were two qualities about the book that distracted me from liking the story more:1.  The author is/was a crusader.  And while his cause is good, I felt betrayed in that in order to read a good story, I had to also read his propaganda.  I suspect though that his cause is a thread that winds through all three books.2.  The translation from Swedish to American English is not good.  Maybe it works better as British English.  There are dozens of places in the book where I sat back and thought, ""What's he trying to say?""  or ""We don't say things like that"".  Early in the book I thought it would improve, but it didn't.  However the story's mystery and suspense overrides the suboptimal translation.Overall, good story, while those two points kept me from enjoying it more.",,

I struggled at times because I was unfamiliar with the Swedish place names; and many of the character names were so similar that I had to keep a running list to distinguish them.  But the story is AMAZING.  After I looked up some bio info about Larsson, I understood the story more.  I recommend that readers check him out as well.  The other reviews here describe the story, so I'm sticking to the ""why"" you should read it.  It's a tale with corners, closets, twists, and turns.  And the character development for Lisbeth and Blomkvist makes them ""real.""  This novel and the next (The Girl Who Played with Fire) are excellent reads for people who enjoy getting to know the characters and taking a fascinating ride along with them.",,

It crisscrosses between two storylines, one about the disappearance of a woman many years ago, and a current investigation of a journalist into some financial malpractices, and ultimately the two storylines intersected at the end. The two main protagonists are the battle-scarred journalist in his early 40s and a computer genius lady in her early twenties. Some of the gory content could have been easily avoided without diminishing the value of the book. Overall quite a gripping thriller and was a good read.",,
Aaron S. Jacobs,"Reviewed in the United States on July 11, 2010",One person found this helpful,4.0 out of 5 stars,"A slow start, but a strong finish","As with just about everyone, I heard about the book by word of mouth.  I decided to download it to my Kindle and, after reading the sample, thought it was worth the $7.15 gamble.  After eventually getting around to the book, I made it through a few chapters and thought it was OK.  I almost put it down (or, more accurately, started moved on to the next book on the Kindle), but I decided to press on in light of the buzz Larsson's books have generated.  I'm glad I did.Perhaps it is because it was Larsson's first book and, presumably, he wrote the earlier sections first, but the book took a while to get into.  Don't let that stop you.  Once I made it into the heart of the book, it was enthralling and I had a hard time putting it down.  Indeed, I was so taken with it that I wandered off to another room when I got within striking distance of the finish so I could read after my wife had gone to sleep.Larsson's strength is not character, at least not in this novel.  Blomkvist, the primary protagonist, just isn't all that interesting, and I didn't care much about his background and life.  Salander has a little more depth, and she starts to really come through by the end; you can tell that her psychology (and psychopathy) is going to shine at some point, just not in this book.  Larsson's strength is, instead, a story that keeps you hooked.  In that respect, this book was somewhat like Neil Stephenson's books:  One dimensional characters of vague interest in vaguely absurd settings that keep your eyes on the page and your mind so engaged you can't put it down.",,

The imagery and family history cast up by Sir Stieg Larsson is exceptionally unique for its time.  Lisbeth is invigorating and unrelenting.

L. J. Roberts,"Reviewed in the United States on November 9, 2009",3 people found this helpful,3.0 out of 5 stars,A lot that bothered me...,"First Sentence:  it happened every year, was almost a ritual.Journalist Mikael Blomkvist trusted his source and ended up being convicted of libel.  Lisbeth Salander is a tattooed punk about whose history no one knows, but is a very skilled investigator.  They join forces to solve the case of the missing grand-niece of an elderly, wealthy industrialist with a completely dysfunctional family.The opening is excellent; not overly dramatic, but subtle and intriguing.  After that, however, it took me a long time to get into the story.  I found the first half of it a bit plodding, but at no point was I tempted to stop reading.In retrospect, I realize my overall feeling was that I liked the book, yet when I look at it in parts, there was a lot that bothered me.  I like particularly liked Liz.  She was, by far, the most interesting and intriguing character, and I want to know more about her.  The other characters weren't bad but didn't do much for me.  Even Mikael only became really interesting after he and Liz starting working together.  The author has a thing about names with ""B"" and ""S"", which became distracting.He also likes portents--little ones, occasionally--but they drive me crazy.  Another irritant was that the book was filled with product placement; it occasionally seemed to be a large Apple advertisement.On the other hand, I was amused by the references to the contemporary mysteries the character was reading.  I do wish the sense of place were stronger.  The village could be set anywhere where there is winter; I don't get a real sense of it being Sweden.The plot itself was only okay.  There were almost three plots; Mikael clearing his name, Liz obtaining her freedom and the missing granddaughter.  Larsson did do a good job in bringing the three plots together, yet it all felt a bit improbable.I might read the other two books in the series, but don't feel compelled to so do.THE GIRL WITH THE DRAGON TATTOO (Myst-Mikael Blomkvist/Lisbaeth Salander-Sweden-Cont) - GLarsson, Steig - 1st in seriesVintage Crime, 2008, Trade Paperback- ISBN:  9780307454546",VINE VOICE,

But that's not an objection everyone will have of course.If you like immersive action and mystery with a nice dose of social justice and strong women characters, you will surely not be disappointed with the adventures and exploits of Lisbeth Salander.

Deborah M,"Reviewed in the United States on November 4, 2010",6 people found this helpful,3.0 out of 5 stars,The Core Mystery Is Great; Everything Else is Meh.,"I was really, really looking forward to reading The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo. How could I not? It's been on the best-seller list for ages, and people I know have raved about it over and over again. I guess I was a bit surprised to find that even though I enjoyed it, I wasn't thrilled with the book at all. In fact, the more I thought about it, the less I enjoyed it. A few thoughts:---The main mystery is very, very intriguing and I liked reading about Harriet Vanger's disappearance. There are some interesting twists and turns in this storyline, and it fully kept my attention. My only quibble is that it really doesn't take up very much of the book at all.---I really hated the portions of the novel (basically the entire beginning and ending) that involved Blomkvist and his magazine. Once the mystery is solved, there are about 100 pages devoted to Blomkvist trying to salvage his reputation and get back at his nemesis, Wennerström (who, strangely enough, we never actually meet in the book; he is only referred to by other people, lessening any impact he could have for the reader). I can't even begin to describe how boring this was for me to read. I found myself scanning page after page, desperately wishing this storyline would come to an end.---There is a very unnecessary rape scene in the book, which I did not expect. I don't mind violence in my reading material, but I felt like this scene was immaterial to the story at hand. There are better ways of showing the vulnerability/revenge tendencies of a character, and the entire thing struck me as gratuitous. I found it painful to read.If you took out the scenes of Blomkvist's business troubles, I think you have a really stellar mystery on your hands; unfortunately, the mystery is sandwiched in between a lot of instances I just couldn't bring myself to care about. Lisbeth Salandar is an interesting character, and I wished that the book focused more on her, as opposed to the exceptionally bland Blomkvist (why are women constantly falling for this beige, boring man?). Still, there is something very intriguing about this book, even though I can't quite put my finger on it, and I just may read the next entry in the trilogy.Note: I bought the Kindle edition and was pleased to see that it was well-formatted and did not contain any major errors.",,
Amy K,"Reviewed in the United States on December 31, 2010",One person found this helpful,5.0 out of 5 stars,Couldn't put it down...,"Hard to describe this series in a few words, but I thought they were brilliant.  I don't normally read mystery/thriller kinds of books, but I thoroughly enjoyed them.  They read with the pace of a Jason Bourne movie.  Sweden made them into movies, and I'm hoping Hollywood does their own versions.  The first book was definitely the most graphic...and I think I enjoyed the plot of the 2nd two books best.  Some of my friends didn't like the first one for the way it deals with severe sexual trauma...but if you read all three, you understand why he put that in there.Overall, what stuck with me about these books is the way that Larsson exposes injustice against women.  Aspects of Lisbeth's story will strike a chord with many female readers, I think.  It's refreshing to read something that goes to such great lengths to get across the message he was trying to convey.  Tragic that he's no longer around to be interviewed by Oprah.  :)",,

The two main characters are drawn so well that you can get inside there heads as the ball starts rolling and you become part of the force that drives the story.

Gary Griffiths,"Reviewed in the United States on September 11, 2009",One person found this helpful,5.0 out of 5 stars,If Hitchcock was from Stockholm...,"His work would probably look a lot like this.Believe the hype - the late Stieg Larsson's ""Girl with the Dragon Tattoo"" is that rare best seller that is well written and intelligent while complex and threaded with multiple themes without sacrificing readability.Mikael Blomkvist, an investigative reporter and principal in a boutique Stockholm financial periodical, is trapped in a libel suit against a rich and powerful industrialist.  In order to protect the identity of his source, he mounts only a feeble defense, costing him a short prison term, his job, and his reputation.  While in forced a exile aimed at figuring out where to take his wrecked life, he is contracted by the retired business scion Henrik Vanger, an octogenarian tormented for half of his life by the unsolved disappearance and apparent murder of his grand niece Harriet.  Vanger offers Blomkvist the lucrative opportunity to chronicle the Vanger family history as a ruse for investigating Harriet's demise.  Enter Lisbeth Salander, an anorexic twenty-something pierced and tattooed social recluse, but a personal investigator enigma of idiot savant-like capabilities.This is a multi-layered novel that delivers across increasingly deepening strata.  On the surface, it is simply a terrific mystery - a well spun yarn of a four-decades old murder, the classic ""murder in a locked room"" set on an island made inescapable due to a wrecked tanker blocking the bridge, a game of ""Clue"" played on an epic scale.One level lower, it is a pleasantly twisted love story that only works given Sweden's casual morality and sexual freedom.  Larsson's romance angle fits deftly into the storyline, never distracting the reader from the primary dark path along which the author leads, but building sexual tension that complements the sinister storyline.  Which says a lot about Larsson's well-drawn and likeable characters, from the affable Blomkvist to the aggressive and infinitely more interesting Salander, a disturbed and dangerous young woman with open surface hostilities masking and protecting a more sensitive inside.  Salander is the latest - and best - of strong renegade punk female protagonists, a trend that goes back at least as far as Cae Hardin in Boston Teran's cult crime classic ""God is a Bullet"", and more recently in Joe Hill's ""Heart Shaped Box"" or Derek Nikitas' gripping but undiscovered ""Pyres"".On a deeper level, Stieg Larsson's Scandinavian backdrop is the perfect setting for this story that, like Sweden's seasons and culture, turns unexpectedly brutal despite the pastoral and friendly setting and genteel society.  Socialist Larsson takes multiple swipes at capitalism and those who practice it, but thankfully he stays far enough away from the soapbox to preserve the strength of his story and his cast.Larsson may be at the top of a recent flood of fine Scandinavian crime fiction translated for US readers.  While still capturing that classic fatalism of northern European lit, Larsson stops a few shades light of Arnaldur Indridason's Stygian black but gripping Icelandic crime novels featuring the morose Inspector Erlander Sveinsson.  And if his prose falls short of Karin Fossum's beautifully written Norwegian mysteries, Larsson is, if not more readable, at least more commercially attractive.  Or Jo Nesbo, whose Oslo settings may be the closest match to Larsson's page-turning drama and riveting action.In short, a true blockbuster that had me stopping by Amazon half way through to pick up the sequel, ""The Girl Who Played with Fire.""  It's a shame that Larsson won't be around to keep this intriguing series going, so make sure to savor these.",,

It was great for sleeping but not so good for reading!Everywhere I went, people were raving about how fantastic this book was, and I was astonished, since I thought it was a complete bore!

The story just gets better and better the further you go along.  By the half-way point, I was finally starting to get interested and wanting to keep reading.  By the final third, I couldn't put it down.The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo ends up being a great murder mystery that delves into the closets of rich and powerful characters, tossing skeletons left and right.  I have read a lot of novels about devious, sadistic killers, but I have never read anything quite like this.The thing that made it different from a novel by Jeffery Deaver or Patricia Cornwell is that it wasn't JUST a murder mystery--it was a sweeping family saga, a portrait of two troubled young girls, a story of financial intrigue AND a murder mystery all rolled into one book.  And Lizbeth Salander (one of the aforementioned troubled young girls) is a character you are not likely to forget.If I could grade the parts of this book separately, I'd give the last third 5 stars, the first third 2 stars and the middle third 3 1/2 stars.

J. Romeo,"Reviewed in the United States on August 30, 2010",4 people found this helpful,3.0 out of 5 stars,Girl goes bust,"(!BE AWARE SPOILERS AHEAD!) The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo is not the-end-all-be-all that a lot of people are making it out to be and it's certainly not the return of noir fiction that a lot of the critics were yammering about when it was first published. In fact, the book is only average in story and writing. Girl is on par with a John Grisham novel or a Patricia Cornwell novel in that everything is neat and easy. What I mean by ""neat and easy"" is that there is no thinking required in this novel. Everything that happens in the novel is spelled out for the reader. Unlike true detective stories, or the noir fiction of Dashiell Hammett, we are never left guessing that one possible out come is just as possible as another. There's never a zig when we thought we were going to zag. As disgusting as Girl can be at times, there's rape, mutilation, torture, and promiscuous sex just for good measure, we never really fear that our heroes won't find out the mysteryby the end the novel. Everything is solved by a keystroke or other weak plot devices that border on the absurd. Nothing is ever in question and we never fear what is around the next corner because whatever it is we know that our heroes will make it out alive. Girl is full of moments that make you scratch your head and pause for a moment. A keystroke reveals the whole mystery in the book, which was obvious early on in the novel. It took the male protagonist, super-reporter Mikael Blomvkist, moments to find clues in a picture that was over 40 years old. It's possible that the police and Henrik Vanger, the patriarch of the Vanger family who set the whole novel in motion, could have over looked obvious clues. However, we are told that both parties had studied everything in detail concerning the case. A few keystrokes later in the novel, after a pathetic set up, reveals that one of the many uncles floating around is...(hold your collective breath)... a serial killer. When I say serial killer I don't mean the Ted Bundy type of serial killer, but the Nazi in jackboots serial killer. When the secret is revealed, to a tied up Blomvkist, it's done in the most stereotypical fashion-the killer reveals everything and more because he has the hero of the story chained up in a chair! It's a corny let-me-tell-you-everything Hollywood ending. All that was missing was a diabolical laugh. Which only leads to another WTF moment in the novel. If Lisbeth was a computer hacker and all around whiz, why didn't she create a program that made it seem that money was being deposited in the account that Bjurman, her legal guardian in the novel, was in control of while her actual money was being deposited in an account of her choosing? Larsson went out of his way to tell us (another problem with the novel; we are told things, but never shown things) that Lisbeth, heroine extraordinaire, can hack into computers of multi-conglomerates and get away with it. A small program, like the one I mentioned, would be nothing to accomplish. Another problem with Girl is the girl. In Lisbeth Salander, Larsson has created a heroine on par with Wonder Woman. There's nothing wrong with a strong heroine in a novel. Larsson should be applauded for the attempt, but he goes way beyond the ""I am woman hear me roar"" mentality of the women's rights movement. He has created a heroine that can do anything and beat anyone at anything. This makes it hard to write situations that keep the reader in suspense. Lisbeth can literally do anything and beat anyone. Larsson hasn't so much created a strong female character as created demigod. The movie fares no better, but what can one do when the source material is weak? It doesn't help that the director, Niels Arden Oplev, had made a movie that is almost shot for shot from the book. There's a reason why most books made into movies are tweaked for the screen- not everything in the novel translates well to the big screen. Sometimes a director has to lose, or even add, certain things from a novel so that the movie will have a flow. Oplev does try does his best to ratchet up the creepy factor through flashbacks inspired by David Fincher's Seven. However, it only serves to remind us that the entire movie was doomed from the start. A lot of people get furious when someone they don't agree with is cast in a movie from their favorite book. Readers were mad when Tom Cruise was cast to play Lestat in Interview with the Vampire. Comic geeks were irate when Christopher Nolan went with Heath Ledger to play Joker. I'm not one of these people. I figure the director knows what's going on with their film. However, I have to make an exception in this case. In the novels, Lisbeth is described as being 24. So, whom does the casting agent decide to go with? That's right, an actress who appears closer to 40 than 24. The bad casting decision shatters any possibility that the Lisbeth Salander character had at being believable. The book and the movie do little to dispel my already cynical view that both the publishing and movie world cater to the lowest common denominator. However, the American remake may be better than the original. A lot of people won't agree with me because a lot of people subscribe to the bourgeois view point that if it's coming out of Hollywood it will be garbage. Even having Fincher direct the project won't change the minds of these pseudo-intellectuals. I, for one, can't wait to see the American remake. Fincher has directed some of the creepiest and grittiest movies made in the past fifteen years. Hopefully, Fincher will add a level of mystery and suspense that both the book and the original movie are sorely lacking. Just remember: The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo is not noir fiction, Stieg Larsson is no Raymond Chandler, and you have better things to do with the two hours it will take to watch the movie.

I'm not into mysteries and who done its this is totally different. I wasn't expecting this at all. The characters are really well developed, there wasn't any drag anywhere and not once did I have urge to skip anything and the endings to each of the books aren't anti-climactic in any way shape or form. These books do have a violent nature so careful. The best way to describe Lisbeth Salander is the perfet anti-heroin. I love her character. It's a real disappointment and a huge loss that Stieg Larsson passed away, I could not even fathom what his other books would have been like.",,

I am already figuring out when I can start reading the next two books, but for now, you can't go wrong with this book.It is a little on the violent side, but not over the top.

The entire thing to page 408 was one long information dump, and the secondary story line was totally left hanging at the end. Lisbeth Salander was by far the more interesting character, sensitively written and very enigmatic but it was her story that was left hanging at the end.

Monica Karem EC,"Reviewed in the United States on October 8, 2010",,5.0 out of 5 stars,Instantly addictive,"As soon I starting reading ""Men who hate women"" aka ""The girl with the dragon tattoo"" I couldn't stop. I like reading about the books I'm about to read because I want to know what I'm about to embark on. The reviews for this book were generally good but there were a handfull of bad reviews. Even though I can see why someone might not like a long start to a crime/detective/ mystery novel I must say I find it only builds up the suspense. I did not find this book needlessly long. It is however not a book for just any occasional mystery novel reader. The book plays in Sweden so it's very helpful to know a bit more about this country. I find that reading a bit on Sweden's political and financial affairs (like on wikipedia) helps the story come more alive. It's important to at least know that Sweden is a nation that has ranked in the top 10 best countries to live in and also among the top 10 with the least gender inequity according to the UN Human Development Report 2007/2008. This of course is a great contrast with the center plot of the book and thus with the original Swedish titel. I found it a very interesting book and I am definitely going to be reading the other 2 books of the series. If you like mystery, though smart women, an under dog story, and have a socio-political interest then this book is definitely for you.These are some links to the UN Human Development Report 2007/2008 (most recent they are based on data from 2007)[...]",,

Richard B.  Schwartz,"Reviewed in the United States on July 15, 2010",2 people found this helpful,5.0 out of 5 stars,Superb in Interesting Ways,"It truly is superb and in interesting ways, but be wary of the hype and the jacket blurbs.  It is not, for example, a piledriving page-turner.  The story builds very slowly and deliberately.  The relationship between the title character and the protagonist does not develop until we are more than half way through a very long book.  The plot is very textured and layered.  It is atmospheric, but not in the style of a James Lee Burke.  Instead of flora, fauna and deep local history we have place names, street names and some corporate names.  `Ikea noir' is one person's description, but there is little Ikea here and a great deal of noir.  The story is simple: a journalist convicted of libel is hired to investigate the disappearance (decades ago) of a rich industrialist's beloved niece.  The industrialist's lawyer hires an investigative firm to check out the journalist and is pleased with the work of one of their freelance operatives, a young, seemingly anorexic, tattooed and pierced computer hacker.  The hacker and the journalist join forces to plumb the heart of darkness in freezing Sweden.The claim that the book represents  the union of Ingmar Bergman and Thomas Harris is accurate.  The focus is on people, troubled sexual people, and while the depravity that is uncovered is violent and perverse the story is about the detectives, particularly the young woman, whose journey to the novel's conclusion involves several forms of personal redemption.The woman, Lisbeth Salander, is Larsson's most memorable creation.  Although the journalist, Blomkvist, has most of the time on stage, that stage comes to life whenever Salander enters.  She is the kind of character who is capable of becoming a cultural icon in the manner of Hannibal Lecter.  Deeply flawed and troubled, she has the rarest of gifts.  We simply cannot get enough of her.  Fortunately, there are two other books and part of a fourth awaiting us.Several of my female friends have lamented the book's violence, violence which is largely directed at women.  There is such violence, but it is briefly (though specifically) described.  It is not lingered over at length in a salacious way.  It is there, however; we are not in the world of Jane Austen.  On the other hand, we ARE in the world of Lisbeth Salander, who has little patience with those who would abuse her or other women.  Her responses to that abuse are of the sort that the airborne rangers describe as `on-the-spot corrections'.  She can wield a laptop computer but she can also wield a field-expedient weapon with the best of them.The plot reminded me a little of a Val McDermid novel (a novelist read by Blomkvist in the course of this story): layered, textured, slow to develop, but always ominous.  The centerpiece is a fascinating character, à la Thomas Harris, and the plot's surprises and mystification with regard to pace are slightly reminiscent of Jeffery Deaver.  In English translation at least, the writing is workmanlike, but not exceptionally rich or philosophic.  While not `unputdownable', I hated to see it end, particularly with the lingering series of delicious conclusions.Highly recommended.",TOP 500 REVIEWER VINE VOICE,Top Contributor: Philosophy

Arthur Tirrell,"Reviewed in the United States on April 24, 2010",2 people found this helpful,5.0 out of 5 stars,THE REAL GEM HERE IS LISBETH,"Henrik Vanger, in his eighties, longs to know the identity of the person who every year on his birthday sends him a single exotic species of flower - a flower that renews memories of a niece long ago missing and presumed dead.Carl Blomkvist, thirtyish, values journalistic integrity above all else, but he's facing ninety days in jail and a 150,000 fine, all because he, a respected publisher, has been convicted of libel.Lisbeth Salander, twenty-four, a private investigator who, despite her anti-social behavior, her boss has come to value as the most able operator he's ever had.Three characters, yes, but of them the real gem is Lispeth, pale, pierced, anorexic, hostile, and so much more. Her story is...unfinished...and the author, darn it, leaves it that way.Judge for yourself: Lisbeth, as summarized by her boss the first time he sees her -""She looked like she just emerged from a week-long orgy with a gang of hard rockers.""Lisbeth: hair ""short as a fuse;"" a pierced nose and eyebrows; a wasp tattoo on her shoulder; red hair died black; and a tattoo of a dragon on her back. But despite these disfigurings, under it all, a beauty. She's attractive, both to her tough old boss and to the reader, neither of whom can fail to be mesmerized by this dynamic enigma of a child-woman who through it all displays what could be under-described as, ""a rather trying attitude.""Putting it mildly.There is more, much more to Lisbeth. She is rich beyond measure as a character, but as the plot proceeds to gain and lose and then regain momentum, the author withholds her. We get small bits here and there as Carl Blomkvist meets her. They become associates in the search for answers to Henrik Vanger's questions. Carl begins to fall for her, and we begin to see the full scope of Lisbeth's amazing...I better stop telling about her right here.Despite dragging at times as Larsson digs into the often mundane intimate details of his characters' lives, and overlooking the fact that the author never really delivers a denouement between the two principle characters, this novel still adds up to a stellar read. Thank God the second book will continue the story. I've got to see what happens with Lisbeth and Carl.Art Tirrell is the author of The Vitaman Effect",,

I love Stieg Larsson's way of writing and how he portrays his characters and their lives.  Once I read the first book, I was hooked. I had to get the second.

LS,"Reviewed in the United States on March 18, 2011",,4.0 out of 5 stars,Great Read!,"The Girl WithThe Dragon Tattoo is incredible! It is a very intricate story of intrigue, a page turner of superior depth. You have to pay close  attention to the details while your reading or you will miss what is going on, and who is speaking, as it changes continuously!  The main characters are not your typical run of the mill, great care was given to create believable but different kinds of ""heroes"".  Mr. Larsson did a very good job at painting the picture for the setting of this book. I couldn't put this book down, and ordered the second book of the trilogy as soon as I finished the first. ( I wanted to state that I read the kindle version of this book, so that is what this review is based on.) With all this said, here are a few negatives...it isn't for the faint hearted as there are some definitely dark, deviant sexual themes involved. There is definitely some "" vigilante"" behavior in our "" hero"" character, Lisbeth, though when it happens I actually felt like cheering her on.

Hooked,"Reviewed in the United States on December 26, 2010",4 people found this helpful,5.0 out of 5 stars,Do not quit reading this book before p. 220,"The type of mystery I'm used to starts off with a bang and takes you on a wild ride. This wasn't that. I found the first chapter kind of boring and the first third plodding. Then I hit page 219. This book's pace feels a little like the first hill of a roller coaster ride. It chugs up the hill and you wonder what all the hype is about, then at p. 219 it starts a free fall down the hill gaining momentum until the end. I read the first 219 pages in a week and the last 370 pages in two days.Plot summary:Reporter Blomkvist is hired by rich patriarch Vanger to examine the cold case of how his niece Harriet disappeared 40 years ago. In their research Blomkvist and his unorthodox assistant Salander uncover gruesome family secrets.My opinion:Holy cow is this good. The story is complex, rich, and in-depth. Most of the details you think are just color are actually significant so pay attention. Larsson may have written one of the most fascinating characters in fiction in Lisbeth Salander the goth, brainiac hacker. Blomkvist is an odd hero; he's ethical as a journalist though morally suspect in a Bohemian kind of way that is a lot more forgiving in a 25 year-old than in a 45 year-old. The characters may not be likeable to some, but they are complete, well-rounded, fascinating and complex. The plot is compelling if gruesome and disturbing at several points. Be warned.There were some writing style things that bugged me personally: A lot of the scenes start in one POV and end in someone else's POV (the pivotal office scene on p. 220 is an example). The names can get very confusing. Where most authors try to avoid even using the same letter in naming their characters, Larsson uses names like Henrik, Harriett, and Harold living on Hedeby Island off Hedestad. He'll refer to a character by three names such as: Berger, Erika and Ricky, but despite some of these minor annoyances, the story and characters are excellent.This book is compelling, fascinating, unique, unpredictable and not to be missed. It's complex and adult -- and definitely not for the under 21s in my opinion.",,

Joshua D. Reitano,"Reviewed in the United States on August 8, 2011",4 people found this helpful,3.0 out of 5 stars,Connected with the mystery more than the characters,"Mystery novel by recently deceased Swedish writer, Stieg Larsson. The story behind the book's publication is almost as interesting as the novel itself. Larsson died when The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo and the final two books in the trilogy had been sent off to a publisher. After his death, a battle ensued between his long time live in girlfriend of 30 plus years (a common law marriage almost anywhere else) and his brother (whom he was not close to) for the rights to the work (and the proceeds). As it stands, I don't think the girlfriend is getting much of anything, but she is writing a book of her own about what life was like with Stieg Larsson.The book itself is a mystery. A financial journalist gets drawn into a decades old investigation of a missing (and presumed murdered) 16 year old girl. Complicating matters is the history of the family: a rich industrialist clan whose members largely hate each other. On the day of the girl's disappearance there was a car accident that closed down the only accident to Hedeby Island. Where could the girl have gone? If she was killed, where is the body? There was a limited number of people on the island that day, and yet they all seem to have an alibi.The murder mystery plot is quite good. I want give you any spoilers. But rather than just fun, the subtext of the story is violence against women - indicated both in what is uncovered as the story goes along, and Larsson's section headings (all of which list statistics about violent crimes against women in Sweden). In addition to wanting to write a page turner, Larsson wanted to raise awareness of a very real issue in Swedish culture.Why only three stars? While I thought the plot was great (especially about 200 pages of the 620 pages in), and the dialogue was interesting, I never really connected with the characters. Perhaps they weren't sympathetic enough. Perhaps I operate from too different a worldview. I never felt like I understood where the main characters were coming from, or why they would decide what they would decide. It was still interesting, but it left me with a disconnect to the book.Additionally, there were several depictions of violent rape in the story. While I'm sure Larsson included this in an attempt to call attention to how heinous these crimes are against women, I found these pages terribly uncomfortable to read. I believe the fierceness and the horror of the crimes could have been depicted by describing the long-term affects on the victims and their families without a blow by blow account of the attacks themselves. This I'm sure is a point of debate, but I'm writing the review - so there's my opinion.Not sure if I'm sufficiently motivated to read the next two novels.",,

M. Skwiat,"Reviewed in the United States on May 31, 2010",2 people found this helpful,5.0 out of 5 stars,A 21st Century Mystery I can sink my teeth in!,"When I was thinking of reviewing this novel I was teetering towards 4 or 4 1/2 stars, but upon re-reading it once again I can safely say it's one hell of an absorbing mystery.  A lot of press and speculation has been surrounded by this book and most definitely from it's author.  His sudden death after completing the three manuscripts that make up ""the girl"" series is thrilling in it's own right.  Although it's believed he died from natural causes many speculate he was killed by members in the Swedish government.  In any case he left behind three novels that are not only taking America, but the world by storm.  The first novel The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo introduces us to Lisbeth Salander who if this novel continues to be the popular phenomenon that it is could reach the status as the next Jason Borne or Double 007.  In many respects I found her to be superior to these two men because she is both a woman and has the intellectual capacity to recognize her sex and use the advantages that come with it.  This book however is not all about Lisbeth, but features complex and interesting characters like Mikael Blomkvist coffee drinking reporter by day and mystery solver by night.  What I like the best about this novel is that it doesn't take itself too seriously.  The subject matter and the plot are both strong, but I think Larson plays with  the construction of a mystery novel.  Each characters from the main to the supporting all are interesting and fleshed out.  While the ending went into campy and over the top violence it all added to the complexity and the overall strength of the novel.  I was never a big fan of the mystery genre, but reading this novel cracked the deeply problematic cliches that have played the genre fro years.  Larson breathes new life into the genre.  The action never lets up, the suspense never slackens, and the reader anxiously eats all of it up.  A thoroughly superior mystery story!",,

Mysteries and bestsellers and mystery-bestsellers are not my favorite. For me, it is problematic in these two regards: 1) about two-thirds through the book there is no mystery. Some implausible event / occurrence /conversation happens that is there specifically to drive the story forward. I can spot it right away and it takes me out of the story. And, 2) the villains are the villains. No subtlety, no subtext.This book is predictable in that fashion. One more thing, it feels a little bit 'dated' because it's 2002 or perhaps that's the translation.Still, in spite of those detractions, it's a pretty entertaining read with a definite has narrative drive.  There are some interesting tidbits about Scandinavian society, misogyny, corporate evil. Read it for that if not the mystery part.There are two mysteries that are my gold standard in that each was completely entertaining from page 1 to the end: Smillas Sense of Snow by Peter Hoeg and Conspiracy of Paper by David Liss.

I think this added something to the story as well, as I was exposed to a small bit of Swedish culture.I highly recommend this book, and have just purchased the second part of the trilogy titled (in English) ""The Girl Who Played with Fire.""",,
J & L,"Reviewed in the United States on February 15, 2011",,4.0 out of 5 stars,Mixed Emotions,"I decided to start writing reviews since I always read through them before buying a book. This book has so much hype attached to it, that it has an up-hill climb to meet expectations. I found the first half of the book slow, and there were times I wondered what all the fuss was about.  Then it sort of gets a jolt, breakthroughs happen, and I was sucked in. I'm fine with fictional sex and violence, but anyone who is a bit prudish would hate this book. Don't worry too much about all the names that are thrown at you. Just read it and trust that even those in the bleacher seats will be able to follow the action.",,
